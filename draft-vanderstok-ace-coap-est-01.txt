                    EST over secure CoAP (EST-coaps)
                    draft-vanderstok-ace-coap-est-01

Abstract

   Low-resource devices in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) can
   operate in a mesh network using the IPv6 over Low-power Wireless
   Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) and IEEE 802.15.4 link-layer
   standards.  Provisioning these devices in a secure manner with keys
   (often called secure bootstrapping) used to encrypt and authenticate
   messages is the subject of Bootstrapping of Remote Secure Key
   Infrastructures (BRSKI) [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] and
   6tisch Secure Join [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join].
   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030], based on TLS and
   HTTP, is used in BRSKI.  Low-resource devices often use the
   lightweight Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] for
   message exchanges.  This document defines how low-resource devices
   are expected to use EST over secure CoAP (EST-coaps) for secure
   bootstrapping and certificate enrollment. 6LoWPAN fragmentation
   management and minor extensions to CoAP are needed to enable EST-
   coaps.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)
   [RFC4944] on IEEE 802.15.4 [ieee802.15.4] wireless networks is
   becoming common in many industry application domains such as lighting
   controls.  However, commissioning of such networks suffers from a
   lack of standardized secure bootstrapping mechanisms for these
   networks.

   Although IEEE 802.15.4 defines how security can be enabled between
   nodes within a single mesh network, it does not specify the
   provisioning and management of the keys.  Therefore, securing a
   6LoWPAN network with devices from multiple manufacturers with
   different provisioning techniques is often tedious and time
   consuming.

   Bootstrapping of Remote Secure Infrastructures (BRSKI)
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] addresses the issue of
   bootstrapping networked devices in the context of Autonomic
   Networking Integrated Model and Approach (ANIMA).
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] and
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join] also address secure
   bootstrapping in the 6tisch context targeted to low-resource devices.
   BRSKI has not been developed specifically for low-resource devices in
   constrained networks.  Constrained networks use DTLS [RFC6347], CoAP
   [RFC7252], and UDP instead of TLS [RFC5246], HTTP [RFC7230] and TCP.
   BRSKI relies on Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] for
   the provisioning of the operational domain certificates.

   EST-coaps provides a subset of EST functionality and extends EST with
   BRSKI functions.  EST-coaps replaces the invocations of TLS and HTTP
   by DTLS and CoAP invocations thus enabling EST and BRSKI for CoAP-
   based low-resource devices.

   Although EST-coaps paves the way for the utilization of EST for
   constrained devices on constrained networks, some devices will not
   have enough resources to handle the large payloads that come with
   EST-coaps.  The specification of EST-coaps is intended to ensure that
   bootstrapping works for less constrained devices that choose to limit
   their communications stack to UDP/CoAP.  It is up to the network

   designer to decide which devices execute the EST protocol and which
   not.

   EST-coaps is designed for use in professional control networks such
   as Building Control.  The autonomic bootstrapping is interesting
   because it reduces the manual intervention during the commissioning
   of the network.  Typing in passwords is contrary to this wish.
   Therefore, the HTTP Basic authentication of EST is not supported in
   EST-coaps.

   In the constrained devices context it is very unlikely that full PKI
   request messages will be used.  For that reason, full PKI messages
   are not supported in EST-coaps.

   Because the relatively large EST messages cannot be readily
   transported over constrained (6LoWPAN, LLN) wireless networks, this
   document specifies the use of CoAP Block-Wise Transfer ("Block")
   [RFC7959] to fragment EST messages at the application layer.

   Support for Observe CoAP options [RFC7641] with BRSKI is not
   supported in the current BRSKI/EST message flows and is thus out-of-
   scope for this discussion.  Observe options could be used by the
   server to notify clients about a change in the cacerts or csr
   attributes (resources) and might be an area of future work.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Many of the concepts in this document are taken over from [RFC7030].
   Consequently, much text is directly traceable to [RFC7030].  The same
   document structure is followed to point out the differences and
   commonalities between EST and EST-coaps.

   The following terms are defined in the BRSKI protocol
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]: pledge, Join proxy, Join
   Registrar, and Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authorities (MASA).

2.  EST operational differences

   Only the differences to EST with respect to operational scenarios are
   described in this section.  EST-coaps server differs from EST server
   as follows:

   o  Replacement of TLS by DTLS and HTTP by CoAP, resulting in:




Kumar, et al.           Expires September 8, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                     March 2017


      *  DTLS-secured CoAP sessions between EST-coaps client and EST-
         coaps server.

   o  Only certificate-based client authentication is supported, which
      results in:

      *  The EST-coaps client does not support HTTP Basic authentication
         (as described in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC7030])

      *  The EST-coaps client does not support authentication at the
         application layer (as described in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC7030]).

   o  EST-coaps does not support full PKI request messages[RFC5272].

   o  EST-coaps specifies the BRSKI extensions over CoAP as specified in
      section 5 of [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

3.  Conformance to RFC7925 profiles

   This section shows how EST-coaps fits into the profiles of low-
   resource devices as described in [RFC7925].  Within the bootstrap
   context a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used, where the client
   is called "pledge", the Registration Authority (RA) is called Join
   Registrar, which acts at the front-end for the Certificate Authority
   (CA) and receives voucher feedback from as many Manufacturer
   Authorized Signing Authorities (MASA) as there are manufacturers.  A
   Join-Proxy is placed between client and RA to receive join requests
   over a 1-hop unsecured channel and transmitted over the secure
   network to the EST-server.  The EST-server of EST-coaps is placed
   between proxy and RA or is part of RA.

   EST-coaps transports Public keys and certificates.  Private keys can
   be transported as response to a request to a server-side key
   generation as described in section 4.4 of [RFC7030].  In the
   bootstrapping context, EST-coaps transport is limited to the EST
   certificate transport conformant to section 4.4 of [RFC7925].  For
   BRSKI, outside the profiles of [RFC7925], EST-coaps transports
   vouchers, which are YANG files specified in [I-D.ietf-anima-voucher].

   The mandatory cipher suite for DTLS is
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 defined in [RFC7251] which is the
   mandatory-to-implement cipher suite in CoAP.  Additionally the curve
   secp256r1 MUST be supported [RFC4492]; this curve is equivalent to
   the NIST P-256 curve.  The hash algorithm is SHA-256.  DTLS
   implementations MUST use the Supported Elliptic Curves and Supported
   Point Formats Extensions [RFC4492]; the uncompressed point format
   MUST be supported; [RFC6090] can be used as an implementation method.

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                     March 2017


   The EST-coaps client MUST be configured with an explicit TA database
   or at least an implicit TA database from its manufacturer.  The
   authentication of the EST-coaps server by the EST-coaps client is
   based on Certificate authentication in the DTLS handshake.

   The authentication of the EST-coaps client is based on client
   certificate in the DTLS handshake.  This can either be

   o  DTLS with a previously issued client certificate (e.g., an
      existing certificate issued by the EST CA); this could be a common
      case for simple re-enrollment of clients;

   o  DTLS with a previously installed certificate (e.g., manufacturer-
      installed certificate or a certificate issued by some other
      party);

4.  Protocol Design and Layering

   EST-coaps uses CoAP to transfer EST messages, aided by Block-Wise
   Transfer [RFC7959] to transport CoAP messages in blocks thus avoiding
   (excessive) 6LoWPAN fragmentation of UDP datagrams.  The use of
   "Block" for the transfer of larger EST messages is specified in
   Section 4.5.  The Figure 1 below shows the layered EST-coaps
   architecture.

   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    EST request/response messages               |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    CoAP for message transfer and signaling     |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    DTLS for transport security                 |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    UDP for transport                           |
   +------------------------------------------------+

                    Figure 1: EST-coaps protocol layers

   The EST-coaps protocol design follows closely the EST design,
   excluding some aspects that are not relevant for automatic
   bootstrapping of constrained devices within a professional context.
   The parts supported by EST-coaps are identified by their message
   types:

   o  Simple enroll and reenroll.

   o  CA certificate retrieval.

   o  CSR Attributes request messages.

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                     March 2017


   o  Server-side key generation messages.

4.1.  Discovery and URI

   EST-coaps is targeted to low-resource networks with small packets.
   Saving header space is important and the EST-coaps URI is shorter
   than the EST URI.

   The presence and location of (path to) the management data are
   discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-known/core" including
   a resource type (RT) parameter with the value "core.est" [RFC6690].
   Upon success, the return payload will contain the root resource of
   the EST resources.  It is up to the implementation to choose its root
   resource, but it is recommended that the value "/est" is used, where
   possible.  The example below shows the discovery of the presence and
   location of management data.


     REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=core.est

     RES: 2.05 Content </est>; rt="core.est"


   The EST-coaps server URIs differ from the EST URI by replacing the
   scheme https by coaps and by specifying shorter resource path names:

   coaps://www.example.com/est/short-name

   Figure 5 in section 3.2.2 of [RFC7030] enumerates the operations and
   corresponding paths which are supported by EST.  Table 1 provides the
   mapping from the EST and BRSKI URI path to the EST-coaps URI path.

            | BRSKI            | EST              | EST-coaps |

   /requestvoucher and /enrollstatus are needed between pledge and
   Registrar.

4.2.  Payload format

   The content-format (media type equivalent) of the CoAP message
   determines which EST message is transported in the CoAP payload.  The
   media types specified in the HTTP Content-Type header(see section
   3.2.2 of [RFC7030]) are in EST-coaps specified by the Content-Format
   Option (12) of CoAP.  The combination of URI path-suffix and content-
   format used for coap MUST map to an allowed combination of path-
   suffix and media type as defined for EST.  The required content-
   formats for these request and response messages are defined in
   Section 8.  The CoAP response codes are defined in Section 4.4.

   EST-coaps is designed for use between low-resource devices using CoAP
   and hence does not need to send base64-encoded data.  Simple CBOR
   byte string is more efficient (30% less payload compared to base64)
   and well supported by CoAP.  Therefore, the content formats
   specification in Section 8 requires the use of CBOR byte string
   (h'xxxx' in Diagnostic JSON) for all EST-coaps CoAP payloads.

4.3.  Message Bindings

   This section describes BRSKI to CoAP message mappings.

   All /crts, /sen, /sren, /att, /skg, /rv, /vs, and /es EST-coaps
   messages expect a response, so they are all CoAP CON messages.

   The Ver, TKL, Token, and Message ID values of the CoAP header are not
   influenced by EST.

   CoAP options are used to convey Uri-Host, Uri-Path, Uri-Port,
   Content-Format and more in CoAP.  The CoAP Options are used to
   communicate the HTTP fields specified in the BRSKI REST messages.

   BRSKI URLs are HTTPS based (https:// ), in CoAP these will be assumed
   to be transformed to coaps (coaps://)

   Appendix A includes some practical examples of EST messages
   translated to CoAP.

4.4.  CoAP response codes

   Section 5.9 of [RFC7252] specifies the mapping of HTTP response codes
   to CoAP response codes.  Every time the HTTP response code 200 is
   specified in [RFC7030] in response to a GET request, in EST-coaps the
   equivalent CoAP response code 2.05 MUST be used.  Response code HTTP

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                     March 2017


   202 in EST is mapped to CoAP 2.06 as specified in
   [I-D.hartke-core-pending].  All other HTTP 2xx response codes are not
   used by EST.  For the following HTTP 4xx error codes that may occur:
   400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 406, 412, 413, 415 ; the equivalent CoAP
   response code for EST-coaps is 4.xx.  For the HTTP 5xx error codes:
   500, 501, 502, 503, 504 the equivalent CoAP response code is 5.xx.

   Appendix A includes some practical examples of HTTP response codes
   from EST translated to CoAP.

4.5.  Message fragmentation

   DTLS defines fragmentation only for the handshake part and not for
   secure data exchange (DTLS records).  [RFC6347] states "Each DTLS
   record MUST fit within a single datagram".  In order to avoid using
   IP fragmentation, which is not supported by 6LoWPAN, invokers of the
   DTLS record layer MUST size DTLS records so that they fit within any
   Path MTU estimates obtained from the record layer.  In addition,
   invokers residing on a 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 network SHOULD
   attempt to size CoAP messages such that each DTLS record will fit
   within one or two IEEE 802.15.4 frames.

   That is not always possible.  Even though ECC certificates are small
   in size, they can vary greatly based on signature algorithms, key
   sizes, and OID fields used.  For 256-bit curves, common ECDSA cert
   sizes are 500-1000 bytes which could fluctuate further based on the
   algorithms, OIDs, SANs and cert fields.  For 384-bit curves, ECDSA
   certs increase in size and can sometimes reach 1.5KB.  Additionally,
   there are times when the EST cacerts response from the server can
   include multiple certs that amount to large payloads.  CoAP
   [RFC7252]'s section 4.6 describes the possible payload sizes: "if
   nothing is known about the size of the headers, good upper bounds are
   1152 bytes for the message size and 1024 bytes for the payload size".
   Also "If IPv4 support on unusual networks is a consideration,
   implementations may want to limit themselves to more conservative
   IPv4 datagram sizes such as 576 bytes; per [RFC0791], the absolute
   minimum value of the IP MTU for IPv4 is as low as 68 bytes, which
   would leave only 40 bytes minus security overhead for a UDP payload".
   Thus, even with ECC certs, EST-coaps messages can still exceed sizes
   in MTU of 1280 for IPv6 or 60-80 bytes for 6LoWPAN [RFC4919] as
   explained in section 2 of [RFC7959].  EST-coaps needs to be able to
   fragment EST messages into multiple DTLS datagrams with each DTLS
   datagram.  Fine-grained fragmentation of EST messages is essential.

   To perform fragmentation in CoAP, [RFC7959] specifies the "Block1"
   option for fragmentation of the request payload and the "Block2"
   option for fragmentation of the return payload of a CoAP flow.

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                     March 2017


   The BLOCK draft defines SZX in the Block1 and block2 option fields.
   These are used to convey the size of the blocks in the requests or
   responses.

   The CoAP client MAY specify the Block1 size and MAY also specify the
   Block2 size.  The CoAP server MAY specify the Block2 size, but not
   the Block1 size.  As explained in Section 1 of [RFC7959]), blockwise
   transfers SHOULD be used in Confirmable CoAP messages to avoid the
   exacerbation of lost blocks.

   The Size1 response MAY be parsed by the client as a size indication
   of the Block2 resource in the server response or by the server as a
   request for a size estimate by the client.  Similarly, Size2 option
   defined in BLOCK should be parsed by the server as an indication of
   the size of the resource carried in Block1 options and by the client
   as a maximum size expected in the 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large)
   response to a request.

   Examples of fragmented messages are shown in Appendix B.

5.  Transport Protocol

   EST-coaps depends on a secure transport mechanism over UDP that can
   secure (confidentiality, authenticity) the CoAP messages exchanged.

5.1.  DTLS

   DTLS is one such secure protocol.  Within BRSKI and EST when "TLS" is
   referred to, it is understood that in EST-coaps, security is provided
   using DTLS instead.  No other changes are necessary (all provisional
   modes etc are the same as for TLS).

   CoAP was designed to avoid fragmentation.  DTLS is used to secure
   CoAP messages.  However, fragmentation is still possible at the DTLS
   layer during the DTLS handshake when using ECC ciphersuites.  If
   fragmentation is necessary, "DTLS provides a mechanism for
   fragmenting a handshake message over a number of records, each of
   which can be transmitted separately, thus avoiding IP fragmentation"
   [RFC6347].

   EST-coaps does not support full PKI Requests.  Consequently, the
   fullcmc request of section 4.3 of [RFC7030] and response MUST NOT be
   supported by EST-coaps.

   Channel-binding information for linking proof-of-identity with
   message-based proof-of-possession is optional for EST-coaps.  Given
   that CoAP and DTLS can provide proof of identity for EST-coaps
   clients and server, simple PKI messages can be used conformant to

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                     March 2017


   section 3.1 of [RFC5272].  EST-coaps supports the certificate types
   and Trust Anchors (TA) that are specified for EST in section 3 of
   [RFC7030].

   When proof-of-possession is desired, a set of actions are required
   regarding the use of tls-connect, described in section 3.5 in
   [RFC7030] -- Linking Identity and POP Information.  The tls-unique
   information translates to the contents of the first "Finished"
   message in the TLS handshake between server and client.  The client
   is then supposed to add this "Finished" message as a
   ChallengePassword to the PKCS#10 to prove that the client is indeed
   in control of the private key at the time of the TLS session when
   performing a /simpleenroll, for example.  In the case of EST-coaps,
   the same operations can be performed during the DTLS handshake.

   In a constrained CoAP environment, endpoints can't afford to
   establish a DTLS connection for every EST transaction.
   Authenticating and negotiating DTLS keys requires resources on low-
   end endpoints and consumes valuable bandwidth.  The DTLS connection
   SHOULD remain open for persistent EST connections.  For example, an
   EST cacerts request that is followed by a simpleenroll request can
   use the same authenticated DTLS connection.  Given that after a
   successful enrollment, it is more likely that a new EST transaction
   will take place after a significant amount of time, the DTLS
   connections SHOULD only be kept alive for EST messages that are
   relatively close to each other.

5.2.  6tisch approach

   The 6tisch bootstrapping is targeted to the "imprinting" of the
   "pledge" with layer 2 keys.  The content formats for the transport
   are being defined and may be expressed in a YANG module.

   Instead of using transport security, the 6tisch approach relies on
   application security provided by OSCOAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security].

   It is suggested that the EST-coaps communication between pledge and
   registrar, specified in this document, can be freely exchanged with
   the same communication specified in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join] and
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].

   [EDNOTE: The evolution of this section depends on the directions
   taken by 6tisch and anima and the possible commonality that will be
   provided.]

6.  Proxying

   [EDNOTE: This section to be populated.  It will address how proxying
   can take place by an entity that resides at the edge of the CoAP
   network, such as the Registrar, and can reach the BRSKI server
   residing in a traditional "TCP setting".  It makes sense to mention
   the properties that the proxy has to fulfill.]

7.  Parameters

   [EDNOTE: This section to be populated.  It will address transmission
   parameters for BRSKI described in sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the CoAP
   draft.  BRSKI does not impose any unique parameters that affect the
   CoAP parameters in Table 2 and 3 in the CoAP draft but the ones in
   CoAP could be affecting BRSKI.  For example the processing delay of
   CAs could be less then 2s, but in this case they should send a CoAP
   ACK every 2s while processing.]

8.  IANA Considerations

   Additions to the sub-registry "CoAP Content-Formats", within the
   "CoRE Parameters" registry are needed for the below media types.
   These can be registered either in the Expert Review range (0-255) or

A.1.  cacerts

   In EST, an HTTPS cacerts message can be

   GET /.well-known/est/cacerts HTTP/1.1
        User-Agent: curl/7.22.0 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0

        Host: 192.0.2.1:8085
        Accept: */*

   The corresponding secure CoAP request is

   GET coaps://[192.0.2.1:8085]/est/crts

   with CoAP fields

     Ver = 1
     T = 0 (CON)

   is not a primary focus for BRSKI.  It is important for generic EST
   exchanges but would an endpoint device with sufficient user interface
   to allow username/password input from an end user be required to use
   CoAP instead of a full HTTPS exchange?]

Appendix B.  EST-coaps Block message examples

   This section provides a detailed example of the messages using DTLS
   and BLOCK option Block2.  The minimum PMTU is 1280 bytes, which is
   the example value assumed for the DTLS datagram size.  The example
   block length is taken as 64 which gives an SZX value of 2.

   The following is an example of a valid /cacerts exchange over DTLS. .
   The content length of the cacerts response in appendix A.1 of
   [RFC7030] is 4246 bytes using base64.  This leads to a length of 3185
   bytes in binary.  The CoAP message adds around 10 bytes, the DTLS
   record 29 bytes.  To avoid IP fragmentation, the CoAP block option is
   used and an MTU of 127 is assumed to stay within one IEEE 802.15.4
   packet.  To stay below the MTU of 127, the payload is split in 50
   packets with a payload of 64 bytes each.  The client sends an IPv6
   packet containing the UDP datagram with the DTLS record that
   encapsulates the CoAP Request 50 times.  The server returns an IPv6
   packet containing the UDP datagram with the DTLS record that
   encapsulates the CoAP response.  The CoAP request-response exchange
   with block option is shown below.  Block option is shown in a
   decomposed way indicating the kind of Block option (2 in this case
   because used in the response) followed by a colon, and then the block
   number (NUM), the more bit (M = 0 means last block), and block size
   exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by slashes.  The Length 64 is used
   with SZX= 2 to avoid IP fragmentation.  The CoAP Request is sent with

   confirmable (CON) option and the content format of the Response is
   /application/cacerts.

                 <--   (2:49/0/64) 2.05 Content

   For further detailing the CoAP headers of the first two blocks are
   written out.

   The header of the first GET looks like:


     Ver = 1
     T = 0 (CON)
     Code = 0x01 (0.1 GET)
     Options
      Option1 (Uri-Host)
        Option Delta = 0x3  (option nr = 3)
        Option Length = 0x9
        Option Value = 192.0.2.1
      Option2 (Uri-Port)
        Option Delta = 0x4   (option nr = 3+4=7)
        Option Length = 0x4
        Option Value = 8085
      Option3 (Uri-Path)
        Option Delta = 0x4    (option nr = 7+4=11)
        Option Length = 0x9
        Option Value = /est/crts
     Payload = [Empty]


   The header of the first response looks like:

   [EDNOTE: The contents of the payload do not need to be written as
   they are encoded with DTLS into something unreadable.]
