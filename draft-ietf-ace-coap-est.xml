	<t>"Classical" Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"/> 
	is used for authenticated/authorized endpoint certificate enrollment (and 
	optionally key provisioning) through a Certificate Authority (CA) or 
	Registration Authority (RA). EST messages run over HTTPS. </t>
   
   <t>This document defines a new transport for EST based on the Constrained 
   Application Protocol (CoAP) since some Internet of Things (IoT) devices 
   use CoAP instead of HTTP. Therefore, this specification utilizes DTLS 
   <xref target="RFC6347"/>, CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/>, and UDP instead of 
   TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/> and TCP. </t> 
   
   <t>EST responses can be relatively large and for this reason this
   specification also uses CoAP Block-Wise Transfer <xref target="RFC7959"/> to 
   offer a fragmentation mechanism of EST messages at the CoAP layer. 
   </t>

   <t>This document also profiles the use of EST to only support 
   certificate-based client authentication. HTTP Basic or Digest 
   authentication (as described in Section 3.2.3 of 
   <xref target="RFC7030"/> are not supported. </t>

   <!-- <t>IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) <xref target="RFC4944" /> on IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="ieee802.15.4" /> wireless networks are becoming common in many industry application domains such as lighting controls. Although IEEE 802.15.4 defines how security can be enabled between nodes within a single mesh network, it does not specify the provisioning and management of the keys. Therefore, securing a 6LoWPAN network with devices from multiple manufacturers with different provisioning techniques is often tedious and time consuming. An example use case is the application of Bootstrapping of Remote Secure Infrastructures (BRSKI) <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> </t> -->

    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
	when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
	
    <t>Many of the concepts in this document are taken over from <xref target="RFC7030"/>. Consequently, much text is directly traceable to <xref target="RFC7030"/>. The same document structure is followed to point out the differences and commonalities between EST and EST-coaps.</t>
  </section>  <!-- Terminology -->
  
  <section anchor="profile7925" title="Conformance to RFC7925 profiles">
    <t>This section shows how EST-coaps fits into the profiles of low-resource 
	devices described in <xref target="RFC7925"/>.
	EST-coaps can transport certificates and private keys. Certificates 
	are responses to (re-)enrollment requests or requests for a trusted certificate 
	list. Private keys can be transported as responses to a  
	server-side key generation request as described in section 4.4 of 
	<xref target="RFC7030"/> snd discussed in <xref target="serverkey"/> 
	of this document. </t>
    
    <t>
    As per Sections 3.3 and 4.4 of <xref target="RFC7925" />, the
    mandatory cipher suite for DTLS in EST-coaps is
    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 <xref target="RFC7251"/>. 
    Curve secp256r1 MUST  
    be supported <xref target="RFC8422"/>; this curve is equivalent to the
    NIST P-256 curve. Crypto agility is important, and the
    recommendations in <xref target="RFC7925" /> section 4.4 and any
    updates to RFC7925 concerning Curve25519 and other CFRG curves also apply.
    </t>  
	  
	<t> 
	DTLS1.2 implementations MUST use the Supported Elliptic Curves and Supported
    Point Formats Extensions <xref target="RFC8422"/>. Uncompressed point
    format MUST also be supported. <xref target="RFC6090"/> can be used as
	summary of the ECC algorithms. DTLS 1.3 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13"/>
	implementations differ from DTLS 1.2
    because they do not support point format negotiation in favor of a single
    point format for each curve and thus support for DTLS 1.3 does not mandate 
	point formation extensions and negotiation. 
    </t>
    
    <t>The authentication of the EST-coaps server by the EST-coaps 
	client is based on certificate authentication in the DTLS handshake. 
	The EST-coaps client MUST be configured with at least an Implicit TA database 
	from its manufacturer which will allow for the authenticating the server the 
	first time before updating its trust anchor (Explicit TA) <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>
	
    <t>The authentication of the EST-coaps client is based on a client certificate 
	in the DTLS handshake. This can either be 
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>a previously issued client certificate (e.g., an existing certificate issued 
		by the EST CA); this could be a common case for simple reenrollment of clients. </t>
        <t>a previously installed certificate (e.g., manufacturer-installed IDevID 
		(IEEE 802.1AR <xref target="ieee802.1ar"/> certificate 
        or a certificate issued by some other party); the server 
        is expected to trust the previously installed CA certificate in this case. IDevID's are expected to have 
        a very long life, as long as the device, but under some conditions could expire. In the latter case, 
        the server MAY want to authenticate a client certificate against its trust store 
		although the certificate is expired (<xref target="sec"/>). </t>
    </list></t>

    <t>
      Client authentication via DTLS Client Certificate is mandatory.

  <section anchor="design" title="Protocol Design">
    <t>EST-coaps uses CoAP to transfer EST messages, aided by Block-Wise Transfer

	fragmentation of UDP datagrams. The use of "Block" for the transfer of larger 
	EST messages is specified in <xref target="fragment"/>.

    <section anchor="format" title ="Payload format">
      <t>The content-format (media type equivalent) of the CoAP message determines which 
	  EST message is transported in the CoAP payload. The media types specified in the HTTP 
	  Content-Type header (section 3.2.2 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>) are in EST-coaps 
	  specified by the Content-Format Option (12) of CoAP. The combination of URI path  
	  and content-format in EST-coaps MUST map to an allowed combination of URI and 
	  media type in EST. The required content-formats for these requests and 
	  response messages are defined in <xref target="content-formats"/>. The CoAP response 
	  codes are defined in <xref target="error"/>.</t> 
      <t>EST-coaps is designed for use between low-resource devices and hence does not need 
	  to send Base64-encoded data. Simple binary is more efficient (30% smaller payload) and 
	  well supported by CoAP. Thus, the payload for a given media type follows the ASN.1 
	  structure of the media-type and is transported as straight binary.
      <xref target="cborpair"/> specifies the payload structure when multiple media types 
	  are present in the payload.</t>

        A representation with content format ID 62 contains a collection of representations

    <section anchor="error" title="CoAP response codes">
      <t>Section 5.9 of <xref target="RFC7252"/> and Section 7 of <xref target="RFC8075"/> 
	  specify the mapping of HTTP response codes to CoAP response codes. 
	  Every time the HTTP response code 200 is specified in 
	  <xref target="RFC7030"/> in response to a GET request (/cacerts, /csrattrs), in 
	  EST-coaps the equivalent CoAP response code 2.05 or 2.03 MUST be used. 
	  Similarly, 2.01, 2.02 or 2.04 MUST be used in response to HTTP POST EST requests 
	  (/simpleenroll, /simplereenroll, /serverkeygen ). Response code HTTP 202 
	  Retry-After that existed in EST has no equivalent in CoAP. 
	  <xref target="pending"/> specifies how EST requests over CoAP handle 
	  delayed messages.</t>
	  
	  <t>EST makes use of HTTP 204 and 404 responses when a resource is not available 
	  for the client. The equivalent CoAP error code to use in an EST-coaps responses 
      are 2.04 and 4.04. Additionally, EST's HTTP 401 error translates to 4.01 in 
	  EST-coaps. Other EST HTTP error messages are 400, 423 and 503. Their equivalent 
	  CoAP errors are 4.00, 4.03 and 5.03 respectively. In case a required COAP option (i.e 
	  Content-Format) is omitted, the server is expected to return a 4.02.</t>
    </section> <!-- CoAP response codes -->

    <section anchor="fragment" title="Message fragmentation">
      <t>DTLS defines fragmentation only for the handshake and not for secure data exchange (DTLS records). <xref target="RFC6347"/> states that to avoid using IP fragmentation, which involves error-prone datagram reconstitution, invokers of the DTLS record layer SHOULD size DTLS records so that they fit within any Path MTU estimates obtained from the record layer. In addition, invokers residing on a 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="ieee802.15.4"/> network SHOULD attempt to size CoAP messages such that each DTLS record will fit within one or two IEEE 802.15.4 frames.</t>
	  
      <t>That is not always possible in EST-coaps. Even though ECC certificates are small in size, they can vary greatly based on signature algorithms, key sizes, and OID fields used. For 256-bit curves, common ECDSA cert sizes are 500-1000 bytes which could fluctuate further based on the algorithms, OIDs, SANs and cert fields. For 384-bit curves, ECDSA certs increase in size and can sometimes reach 1.5KB. Additionally, there are times when the EST cacerts response from the server can include multiple certs that amount to large payloads. Section 4.6 of CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/> describes the possible payload sizes: "if nothing is known about the size of the headers, good upper bounds are 1152 bytes for the message size and 1024 bytes for the payload size". Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC7252"/> also suggests that IPv4 implementations may want to limit themselves to more conservative IPv4 datagram sizes such as 576 bytes. <!-- From <xref target="RFC0791"/> follows that the absolute minimum value of the IP MTU for IPv4 is as low as 68 bytes, which would leave only 40 bytes minus security overhead for a UDP payload. --> Even with ECC certs, EST-coaps messages can still exceed MTU sizes on the Internet or 6LoWPAN <xref target="RFC4919"/> (Section 2 of <xref target="RFC7959"/>). EST-coaps needs to be able to fragment messages into multiple DTLS datagrams.</t>
      
	  <t>To perform fragmentation in CoAP, <xref target="RFC7959"/> specifies the "Block1" option for fragmentation of the request payload and the "Block2" option for fragmentation of the return payload of a CoAP flow. As explained in Section 1 of <xref target="RFC7959"/>, blockwise transfers SHOULD be used in Confirmable CoAP messages to avoid the exacerbation of lost blocks. <xref target="RFC7959"/> defines SZX in the block option fields. SZX is used to convey the size of the blocks in the requests or responses. The CoAP client MAY specify the Block1 size and MAY also specify the Block2 size. The CoAP server MAY specify the Block2 size, but not the Block1 size. </t>
	  
      <t><xref target="RFC7959"/> also defines Size1 and Size2 options to provide size information about the resource representation in a request and response. The Size1 response MAY be parsed by the client as a size indication of the Block2 resource in the server response or by the server as a request for a size estimate by the client. Similarly, the Size2 option defined in BLOCK should be parsed by the server as an indication of the size of the resource carried in Block1 options and by the client as a maximum size expected in the 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) response to a request.</t>
	  
      <t>Examples of fragmented EST  messages are shown in <xref target="blockexamples"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="pending" title="Delayed Responses">        
      <t>Server responses can sometimes be delayed. According to section 5.2.2 of 
	  <xref target="RFC7252" />, a slow server can acknowledge the request with 
	  a 2.31 code and respond later with the requested resource representation. 
      In particular, a slow server can respond to an enrollment request with an empty ACK with code 0.00, 
      before sending the certificate to the server after a short delay. If the certificate 
	  response is large, the server will need more than one "Block2" blocks to transfer it. This 
	  situation is shown in <xref target="fig-est-short-wait"/> where a client sends an enrollment 
	  request that uses more than one "Block1" blocks. The server uses an empty 0.00 ACK to announce 
	  the delayed response which is provided later with 2.04 messages containing "Block2" options. 
	  Having received the first 256 bytes in the first "block2" block, the client asks for a block 
	  reduction to 128 bytes in all following "block2" blocks, starting with the second block (NUM=1).</t>

      <t>If the server is very slow (i.e. minutes) in providing the response (i.e. when a manual intervention is needed), 
      the server SHOULD respond with an ACK containing response code 5.03 (Service unavailable) and a Max-Age 
      option to indicate the time the client SHOULD wait to request the content later. After a delay of Max-Age, 
      the client SHOULD resend the identical CSR to the server. As long as the server responds with response code 5.03 
      (Service Unavailable) with a Max-Age option, the client can resend the enrolment request until the server 
	  responds with the certificate or the client abandons for other reasons. </t>
      
      <t>To demonstrate this scenario, <xref target="fig-est-long-wait"/> shows a client sending an enrolment 
	  request that uses more than one "Block1" blocks to send the CSR to the server. The server needs 
      more than one "Block2" blocks to respond, but also needs to take a long delay (minutes) to provide 
      the response. Consequently, the server uses a 5.03 ACK response with a Max-Age option. The client 
	  waits for a period of Max-Age as many times as he receives the same 5.03 response and retransmits 
      the enrollment request until he receives a certificate. Note that in the example below the server 
	  asks for a decrease in the block size when acknowledging the first Block2. </t>

    <section anchor="serverkey" title="Server-side Key Generation">
      <t>Constrained devices sometimes do not have the necessary hardware to generate 
      statistically random numbers for private keys and DTLS ephemeral keys.  
      Past experience has also shown that low-resource endpoints sometimes 
	  generate numbers which could allow someone to decrypt the communication 
	  or guess the private key and impersonate as the device  <xref target="PsQs"/> 
	  <xref target="RSAorig"/>.</t>
	  
      <t>Additionally, random number key generation is costly, thus energy draining. 
      Even though the random numbers that constitute the identity/cert do not 
      get generated often, an endpoint may not want to spend time and energy 
      generating keypairs, and just ask for one from the server. </t> 
	  
      <t>In these scenarios, server-side key generation can be used. The client 
      asks for the server or proxy to generate the private key and the certificate 
      which is transferred back to the client in the server-side key generation 
      response. In all respects, the server SHOULD treat the CSR as it would treat any
      enroll or re-enroll CSR; the only distinction here is that the server
      MUST ignore the public key values and signature in the CSR. These
      are included in the request only to allow re-use of existing
      codebases for generating and parsing such requests.</t>
      
      <t>
	    <xref target="RFC7030" /> recommends the private key returned by the server 
		to be encrypted. This specification provides two methods to encrypt the generated 
		key, symmetric and asymmetric. The methods are signalled by the client by using 
		the relevant attributes (SMIMECapabilities and DecryptKeyIdentifier or 
		AsymmetricDecryptKeyIdentifier) in the CSR request. The symmetric key or 
        the asymmetric keypair establishment method is out of scope of this 
		specification. 
      </t>
	  <t>
	    The sever-side key generation response is returned using a CBOR array <xref target="cborpair"/>. 
		The certificate part exactly matches the response from an enrollment response. 
		The private key can be in unprotected PKCS#8 <xref target="RFC5958"/> 
		format or protected inside of CMS SignedData. The SignedData is signed 
		by the party that generated the private key, which may or may not 
		be the EST server or the EST CA. The SignedData is further protected 
		by placing it inside of a CMS EnvelopedData as explained in Section 4.4.2 
		of <xref target="RFC7030" />. In summary, the symmetricly encrypted key 
		is included in the encryptedKey attribute in a KEKRecipientInfo structure. 
		In the case where the asymmetric encryption key is suitable for transport key 
		operations the generated private key is encrypted with a symmetric key which 
		is encrypted by using the client defined (in the CSR) asymmetric public key 
		and is carried in an encryptedKey attribute in a KeyTransRecipientInfo. 
		Finally, if the asymmetric encryption key is suitable for key agreement, 
		the generated private key is encrypted with a symmetric key which is 
		encrypted by using the client defined (in the CSR) asymmetric public key and 
		is carried in an recipientEncryptedKeys attribute in a KeyAgreeRecipientInfo. 
		<!-- The EnvelopedData is
   returned in the response as an "application/pkcs7-mime" part with an
   smime-type parameter of "server-generated-key" and a Content-
   Transfer-Encoding of "Base64". --> 
	  </t>
	  <t><xref target="RFC7030" /> recommends the use of additional encryption of the 
	  returned private key. For the context of this specification, clients and servers 
	  that choose to support server-side key generation MUST support unprotected (PKCS#8) <!-- MTI --> 
	  private keys. Symmetric or asymmetric encryption of the private key (CMS EnvelopedData) 
	  SHOULD be supported for deployments where end-to-end encryption needs to be provided 
	  between the client and a server. Such cases could include architectures 
	  where an entity between the client and the CA terminates the DTLS connection 
	  (Registrar in <xref target="RAfig"/>).</t>

  <section anchor="DTLS" title = "DTLS Transport Protocol">    
    <t>EST-coaps depends on a secure transport mechanism over UDP that secures the exchanged CoAP messages. DTLS is one such secure protocol. Where TLS is used in the context of EST, it is understood that EST-coaps uses DTLS instead. No other changes are necessary regarding the secure transport of EST messages (all provisional modes etc. are the same as in TLS). <!-- DTLS handshakes use a retramsit times to handle packet loss in lossy environments. as explained in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347#section-3.2.1 --> </t>
    <t>CoAP was designed to avoid fragmentation. DTLS is used to secure CoAP messages. However, fragmentation is still possible at the DTLS layer during the DTLS handshake when using ECC ciphersuites. If fragmentation is necessary, "DTLS provides a mechanism for fragmenting a handshake message over several records, each of which can be transmitted separately, thus avoiding IP fragmentation" <xref target="RFC6347"/>.</t>
    <t>The DTLS handshake is authenticated by using certificates. EST-coaps supports the certificate types and Trust Anchors (TA) that are specified for EST in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>
    <t>CoAP and DTLS can provide proof-of-identity for EST-coaps clients and servers with simple PKI messages as descrbed in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC5272"/>. Moreover, channel-binding information for linking proof-of-identity with connection-based proof-of-possession is OPTIONAL for EST-coaps. When proof-of-possession is desired, a set of actions are required regarding the use of tls-unique, described in section 3.5 in <xref target="RFC7030"/>. The tls-unique information consists of the contents of the first "Finished" message in the (D)TLS handshake between server and client <xref target="RFC5929"/>. The client is supposed to add this "Finished" message as a ChallengePassword in the attributes section of the PKCS#10 Request <xref target="RFC5967"/> Info to prove that the client is indeed in control of the private key at the time of the (D)TLS session establishment. In the case of EST-coaps, the same operations can be performed during the DTLS handshake. For DTLS 1.2, in the event of handshake message fragmentation, the Hash of the handshake messages used in the MAC calculation of the Finished message MUST be computed as if each handshake message had been sent as a single fragment <xref target="RFC6347"/>. The Finished message is calculated as:</t>
<figure align="left"><artwork><![CDATA[
PRF(master_secret, finished_label, Hash(handshake_messages)) 
   [0..verify_data_length-1];
]]></artwork></figure> 
   <t>Similarly, for DTLS 1.3, the Finished message MUST be computed as if each handshake message had been sent as a single fragment following the algorithm described in 4.4.4 of <xref target="RFC8446"/>. The Finished message is calculated as: </t>
<figure align="left"><artwork><![CDATA[
HMAC(finished_key,
    Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context,
    Certificate*, CertificateVerify*))

    * Only included if present.
]]></artwork></figure> 
   <t>In a constrained CoAP environment, endpoints can't afford to establish a DTLS connection for every EST transaction. Authenticating and negotiating DTLS keys requires resources on low-end endpoints and consumes valuable bandwidth. The DTLS connection SHOULD remain open for sequential EST transactions. For example, an EST cacerts request that is followed by a simpleenroll request can use the same authenticated DTLS connection. However, some additional security considerations apply regarding the use of the Implicit and Explicit TA database (<xref target="sec-est"/>)</t>
   <t>Given that after a successful enrollment, it is more likely that a new EST transaction will take place after a significant amount of time, the DTLS connections SHOULD only be kept alive for EST messages that are relatively close to each other. In some cases like NAT rebinding, keeping the state of a connection is not possible when devices sleep for extended periods of time. In such occasions, <xref target="I-D.rescorla-tls-dtls-connection-id"/> negotiates a connection ID that can eliminate the need for new handshake and its additional cost. </t>

    <t>In real-world deployments, the EST server will not always reside within

	that supports TLS/HTTP. In such environments EST-coaps is used by the client 
	within the CoAP boundary and TLS is used to transport the EST messages

    <t>The EST-coaps-to-HTTPS Registrar MUST terminate EST-coaps downstream and 
	initiate EST connections over TLS upstream. The Registrar MUST authenticate 
	and OPTIONALLY authorize the clients and it MUST be authenticated 
	by the EST server or CA. The trust relationship between the Registrar 
	and the EST server SHOULD be pre-established for the Registrar to proxy 
	these connections on behalf of various clients.</t>
    <t>When enforcing Proof-of-Possession (POP) linking, the DTLS tls-unique 
	value of the (D)TLS session needs to be used to prove that the private key 
	corresponding to the public key is in the possession of and was used to 
	establish the connection by the client as explained in <xref target="DTLS"/>). 
	<!-- To do that the 
	client CSR needs to include information from the DTLS connection the 
	client establishes with the server. In EST, that information is the (D)TLS 
	tls-unique value of the (D)TLS session. In the presence of ESTcoaps-to-HTTPS 
	Registrar, the EST-coaps client MUST be authenticated and authorized by the 
	Registrar and the Registrar MUST be authenticated as an EST Registrar client 
	to the EST server. --> The POP linking information is lost between the 
	EST-coaps client and the EST server when a Registrar is present. 
	The EST server becomes aware of the 
	presence of a Registrar from its TLS client certificate that includes 
	id-kp-cmcRA <xref target="RFC6402"/> extended key usage extension (EKU). As 
	explained in Section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>, the EST server SHOULD 
	apply an authorization policy consistent with a Registrar client. For example, 
	it could be configured to accept POP linking information that does not match 
	the current TLS session because the authenticated EST client Registrar has 
	verified this information when acting as an EST server.</t> 
	<t>For some use cases, clients that leverage server-side key generation might 
	prefer for the enrolled keys to be generated by the Registrar if the CA does not 
	support server-side key generation. In these cases the Registrar MUST support  
	random number generation using proper entropy. Such Registrar is responsible 
	for generating a new CSR signed by a new key which will be returned to the 
	client along with the certificate from the CA. </t>

    <t><xref target="est-uri"/> contains the URI mappings between EST-coaps and EST 
	that the Registrar MUST adhere to. <xref target="error"/> of this 
	specification and Section 7 of <xref target="RFC8075"/> define the mappings 
	between EST-coaps and HTTP response codes, that determine how the Registrar 
	MUST translate CoAP response codes from/to HTTP status codes. The mapping from 
	CoAP Content-Type to HTTP Media-Type is defined in <xref target="content-formats"/>. 
	Additionally, a conversion from CBOR major type 2 to Base64 encoding MUST take 
	place at the Registrar when server-side key generation is supported. If 
	CMS end-to-end encryption is employed for the private key, the encrypted 
	CMS EnvelopedData blob should be included in binary in CBOR type 2 downstream 
	to the client. </t>
	<t>Due to fragmentation of large messages into blocks, an EST-coaps-to-HTTP 
	Registrar MUST reassemble the BLOCKs before translating the binary content to 
	Base64, and consecutively relay the message upstream. </t>
    <t>For the discovery of the EST server by the EST client in the CoAP environment, 
	the EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar MUST announce itself according to the rules in  
	<xref target="discovery"/>. The available actions of the  Registrars MUST be 
	announced with as many resource paths necessary. 
	<!-- The discovery of the EST server 
	in the HTTP environment follow the rules specified in <xref target="RFC7030"/> -->.</t>
	<!-- Next paragraph should be removed because e2e encryption is possible. No need for the registrar to decrypt -->
	<!-- <t>When server-side key generation is used, if the private key is protected using symmetric keys then the Registrar needs to encrypt the private key down to the client with one symmetric key and decrypt it from the server with another. If no private key encryption takes place the Registrar will be able to see the key as it establishes a separate connection to the server. In the case of asymmetrically encrypted private key, the Registrar may not be able to decrypt it if the server encrypted it with a public key that corresponds to a private key that belongs to the client. </t> -->

    <t> EST does not impose any unique parameters that affect the 
	CoAP parameters But the CoAP ones could be affecting EST. For 
	example, the processing delay of CAs could be less then 2s, 
	but in this case the EST-coaps server should be sending a CoAP 
	ACK every 2s while processing.</t>
    <t> The main recommendation, based on experiments, 
	<!-- using Nexus Certificate Manager with Californium for 
	CoAP support, communicating with a ContikiOS and tinyDTLS based 
	client, from RISE SICS, --> is to follow the default CoAP 
	configuration parameters. However, depending on the implementation 
	scenario, retransmissions and timeouts can also occur on other 
	networking layers, governed by other configuration parameters.</t>
    
    <t>Some further comments about some specific parameters, mainly from 
	Table 2 in <xref target="RFC7252"/>:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>NSTART: Limit the number of simultaneous outstanding interactions 
	  that a client maintains to a given server. EST-coaps clients SHOULD 
	  use 1, which is the default. A EST-coaps client is not expected to 
      interact with more than one servers at the same time. </t>
      <t>DEFAULT_LEISURE: This setting is only relevant in multicast scenarios, 
	  outside the scope of EST-coaps.</t>
      <t>PROBING_RATE: A parameter which specifies the rate of re-sending 
	  non-confirmable messages. The EST messages are defined to be sent as 
	  CoAP confirmable messages, hence this setting is not applicable.</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>Finally, the Table 3 parameters in <xref target="RFC7252"/> are mainly 
	derived from Table 2. Directly changing parameters on one table would 
	affect parameters on the other.</t>

  <section anchor="sec" title="Security Considerations">
    <section anchor="sec-est" title="EST server considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of Section 6 of <xref target="RFC7030"/> are only 
	  partially valid for the purposes of this document. As HTTP Basic Authentication is 
	  not supported, the considerations expressed for using passwords do not apply.</t>
      <t>Given that the client has only limited resources and may not be able to generate 
	  sufficiently random keys to encrypt its identity, it is possible that the client 
	  uses server generated private/public keys. The transport of these keys is 
	  inherently risky. Analysis SHOULD be done to establish whether server side key 
	  generation enhances or decreases the probability of identity stealing.</t>
	  <t>It is also RECOMMENDED that the Implicit Trust Anchor database used for 
	  EST server authentication be carefully managed to reduce the chance of a 
	  third-party CA with poor certification practices from being trusted. 
	  Disabling the Implicit Trust Anchor database after successfully receiving the 
	  Distribution of CA certificates response (Section 4.1.3 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>) 
	  limits any risk to the first DTLS exchange. Alternatively, in a persistent DTLS 
	  connection where a /sen request follows a /crt in the same connection, a client 
	  MAY choose to keep the connection already authenticated by the Implicit TA open for 
	  efficiency reasons (<xref target="DTLS"/>) by assuming that the identity of the 
	  server is to be trusted. In that case then the Explicit TA MUST be used starting 
	  from the next DTLS connection. </t>
      <t>In cases where the IDevID used to authenticate the client is expired the server 
	  MAY still authenticate the client because IDevIDs are expected to live as long 
	  as the device itself (<xref target="profile7925"/>). In such occasions, checking 
	  the certificate revocation status or authorizing the client using another method 
	  is important for the server to ensure that the client is to be trusted. </t>
	  <t>In accordance with <xref target="RFC7030"/>, TLS cipher suites that include 
	  "_EXPORT_" and "_DES_" in their names MUST NOT be used. More information about 
	  recommendations of TLS and DTLS are included in <xref target="RFC7525"/>.</t>
      <t>As described in CMC, Section 6.7 of <xref target="RFC5272"/>, "For keys that can 
	  be used as signature keys, signing the certification request with the private key 
	  serves as a POP on that key pair". The inclusion of tls-unique in the certificate  
	  request links the proof-of-possession to the TLS proof-of-identity. This implies 
	  but does not prove that only the authenticated client currently has access to the 
	  private key.</t>
      <t>Regarding the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), an adversary could exclude 
	  attributes that a server may want, include attributes that a server may not want, 
	  and render meaningless other attributes that a server may want. The CA is expected 
	  to be able to enforce policies to recover from improper CSR requests. </t>
      <t>Interpreters of ASN.1 structures should be aware of the use of invalid ASN.1 
	  length fields and should take appropriate measures to guard against buffer overflows, 
	  stack overruns in particular, and malicious content in general.</t>
    </section> <!-- EST server considerations -->
	
    <section anchor="sec-proxy" title="HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar considerations">
      <t>The Registrar proposed in <xref target="proxy"/> must be deployed with care, 
	    and only when the recommended connections are impossible. When POP linking is used the 
	    Registrar terminating the TLS connection establishes a new one with the upstream 
		CA. Thus, it is impossible for POP linking to be enforced end-to-end for the EST 
		transaction. The EST server could be configured to accept POP linking information 
		that does not match the current TLS session because the authenticated EST Registrar 
		client has verified this information when acting as an EST server. </t>
	  <t>The introduction of an EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar assumes the client can trust 
		the registrar using its implicit or explicit TA database. It also assumes 
		the Registrar has a trust relationship with the upstream EST server in order 
		to act on behalf of the clients. When a client uses the Implicit TA 
		database for certificate validation, he SHOULD confirm if the server 
		is acting as an RA by the presence of the id-kp-cmcRA <xref target="RFC6402"/> 
		EKU in the server certificate. If the server certificate does not include 
		the EKU, it is RECOMMENDED that the client includes "Linking Identity and 
		POP Information" (<xref target="DTLS"/>) in requests.</t>
	  <t>In a server-side key generation case, if no end-to-end encryption is 
	    used, the Registrar may be able see the private key as it acts as a man-in-the-middle. 
		Thus, the client puts its trust on the Registrar not exposing the private key. </t>
      <t>Clients that leverage server-side key generation without end-to-end encryption 
	    of the private key (<xref target="serverkey"/> have no knowledge 
	    if the Registrar will be generating the private key and enrolling the certificates 
        with the CA or if the CA will be responsible for generating the key. 
	    In such cases, the existence of a Registrar requires the client to put 
	    its trust on the registrar doing the right thing if it is generating the 
	    private key. </t>

    <t>Two examples are presented in this section: 
	    <list style="numbers">
        <t>a cacerts exchange shows the use of Block2 and the block headers</t>
		<t>an enroll exchange shows the Block1 and Block2 size negotiation for request and 
		response payloads.</t>
    </list>	</t>
	<t>The shown payloads are shown unencrypted. In practice the message contents 
	would be binary formatted and transferred over an encrypted DTLS tunnel.</t>
	<t>The corresponding CoAP headers are only shown in <xref target="cacertsblock"/>. 
	Creating CoAP headers are assumed to be generally known.</t>

 <section anchor="cacertsblock" title="cacerts">
    <t>This section provides a detailed example of the messages using DTLS and BLOCK 
	option Block2. The minimum PMTU is 1280 bytes, which is the example value assumed 
	for the DTLS datagram size. The example block length is taken as 64 which gives an 
	SZX value of 2.</t>
    <t>The following is an example of a cacerts exchange over DTLS. The content length of 
	the cacerts response in appendix A.1 of <xref target="RFC7030"/> contains 638 
	bytes in binary. The CoAP message adds around 10 bytes, 
	the DTLS record 29 bytes. To avoid IP fragmentation, the CoAP block option 
	is used and an MTU of 127 is assumed to stay within one IEEE 802.15.4 packet. To stay 
	below the MTU of 127, the payload is split in 9 packets with a payload of 64 bytes 
	each, followed by a last packet of 62 bytes. The client sends an IPv6 packet 
	containing the UDP datagram with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP 
	request 10 times. The server returns an IPv6 packet containing the UDP datagram with the 
	DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP response. The CoAP request-response exchange with block 
	option is shown below. Block option is shown in a decomposed way (block-option:NUM/M/size) 
	indicating the kind of Block option (2 in this case) followed by a colon, and then the block 
	number (NUM), the more bit (M = 0 in Block2 response means it is last block), and block size 
	with exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by slashes.  The Length 64 is used with SZX=2 to avoid IP 
	fragmentation. The CoAP Request is sent with confirmable (CON) option and the content format 
	of the response, even though not shown, is 281 (application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=certs-only). 
	The transer of the 10 blocks with partially filled block NUM=9 is shown below </t>

      In this example the requested Block2 size of 256 bytes, required by the client, 
	  is transferred to the server in the very first request message. The block size 
	  256=(2**(SZX+4)) which gives SZX=4. The notation for block numbering is the same 
	  as in <xref target="cacertsblock"/>. It is assumed that CSR takes N1+1 blocks 
	  and the cert response takes N2+1 blocks. The header fields and the payload are 
	  omitted for brevity.
