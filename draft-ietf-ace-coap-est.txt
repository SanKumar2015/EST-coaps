                    EST over secure CoAP (EST-coaps)
                       draft-ietf-ace-coap-est-12

Abstract

   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is used as a certificate
   provisioning protocol over HTTPS.  Low-resource devices often use the
   lightweight Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for message
   exchanges.  This document defines how to transport EST payloads over
   secure CoAP (EST-coaps), which allows constrained devices to use
   existing EST functionality for provisioning certificates.

2.  Introduction

   "Classical" Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is used
   for authenticated/authorized endpoint certificate enrollment (and
   optionally key provisioning) through a Certificate Authority (CA) or
   Registration Authority (RA).  EST transports messages over HTTPS.

   This document defines a new transport for EST based on the
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) since some Internet of Things
   (IoT) devices use CoAP instead of HTTP.  Therefore, this
   specification utilizes DTLS [RFC6347] and CoAP [RFC7252] instead of
   TLS [RFC8446] and HTTP [RFC7230].

   EST responses can be relatively large and for this reason this
   specification also uses CoAP Block-Wise Transfer [RFC7959] to offer a
   fragmentation mechanism of EST messages at the CoAP layer.

   This document also profiles the use of EST to only support
   certificate-based client authentication.  HTTP Basic or Digest
   authentication (as described in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC7030]) are not
   supported.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Many of the concepts in this document are taken from [RFC7030].
   Consequently, much text is directly traceable to [RFC7030].

4.  DTLS and conformance to RFC7925 profiles

   This section describes how EST-coaps fits into the profiles of low-
   resource devices described in [RFC7925].  EST-coaps can transport
   certificates and private keys.  Certificates are responses to
   (re-)enrollment requests or requests for a trusted certificate list.
   Private keys can be transported as responses to a server-side key
   generation request as described in Section 4.4 of [RFC7030] and
   discussed in Section 5.8 of this document.

   EST-coaps depends on a secure transport mechanism that secures the
   exchanged CoAP messages.  DTLS is one such secure protocol.  No other
   changes are necessary regarding the secure transport of EST messages.

   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    EST request/response messages               |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    CoAP for message transfer and signaling     |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    Secure Transport                            |
   +------------------------------------------------+

                    Figure 1: EST-coaps protocol layers

   As per sections 3.3 and 4.4 of [RFC7925], the mandatory cipher suite
   for DTLS in EST-coaps is TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
   [RFC7251].  Curve secp256r1 MUST be supported [RFC8422]; this curve
   is equivalent to the NIST P-256 curve.  Additionally, crypto agility
   is important, and the recommendations in Section 4.4 of [RFC7925] and
   any updates to it concerning Curve25519 and other curves also apply.

   DTLS 1.2 implementations must use the Supported Elliptic Curves and
   Supported Point Formats Extensions in [RFC8422].  Uncompressed point
   format must also be supported.  DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13]
   implementations differ from DTLS 1.2 because they do not support
   point format negotiation in favor of a single point format for each

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                       May 2019


   curve.  Thus, support for DTLS 1.3 does not mandate point format
   extensions and negotiation.

   CoAP was designed to avoid IP fragmentation.  DTLS is used to secure
   CoAP messages.  However, fragmentation is still possible at the DTLS
   layer during the DTLS handshake when using ECC ciphersuites.  If
   fragmentation is necessary, "DTLS provides a mechanism for
   fragmenting a handshake message over several records, each of which
   can be transmitted separately, thus avoiding IP fragmentation"
   [RFC6347].

   The authentication of the EST-coaps server by the EST-coaps client is
   based on certificate authentication in the DTLS handshake.  The EST-
   coaps client MUST be configured with at least an Implicit TA database
   which will enable the authentication of the server the first time
   before updating its trust anchor (Explicit TA) [RFC7030].

   The authentication of the EST-coaps client MUST be with a client
   certificate in the DTLS handshake.  This can either be

   o  a previously issued client certificate (e.g., an existing
      certificate issued by the EST CA); this could be a common case for
      simple re-enrollment of clients.

   o  a previously installed certificate (e.g., manufacturer IDevID
      [ieee802.1ar] or a certificate issued by some other party); the
      server is expected to trust that certificate.  IDevID's are
      expected to have a very long life, as long as the device, but
      under some conditions could expire.  In that case, the server MAY
      want to authenticate a client certificate against its trust store
      although the certificate is expired (Section 10).

   EST-coaps supports the certificate types and Trust Anchors (TA) that
   are specified for EST in Section 3 of [RFC7030].

   As described in Section 2.1 of [RFC5272] proof-of-identity refers to
   a value that can be used to prove that the private key corresponding
   to the public key is in the possession of and can be used by an end-
   entity or client.  Additionally, channel-binding information can link
   proof-of-identity with an established connetion.  Connection-based
   proof-of-possession is OPTIONAL for EST-coaps clients and servers.
   When proof-of-possession is desired, a set of actions are required
   regarding the use of tls-unique, described in Section 3.5 in
   [RFC7030].  The tls-unique information consists of the contents of
   the first "Finished" message in the (D)TLS handshake between server
   and client [RFC5929].  The client adds the "Finished" message as a
   ChallengePassword in the attributes section of the PKCS#10 Request




van der Stok, et al.    Expires December 1, 2019                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                       May 2019


   [RFC5967] to prove that the client is indeed in control of the
   private key at the time of the (D)TLS session establishment.

   In the case of EST-coaps, the same operations can be performed during
   the DTLS handshake.  For DTLS 1.2, in the event of handshake message
   fragmentation, the Hash of the handshake messages used in the MAC
   calculation of the Finished message must be computed as if each
   handshake message had been sent as a single fragment (Section 4.2.6
   of [RFC6347]).  The Finished message is calculated as shown in
   Section 7.4.9 of [RFC5246].  Similarly, for DTLS 1.3, the Finished
   message must be computed as if each handshake message had been sent
   as a single fragment (Section 5.8 of [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13]) following
   the algorithm described in 4.4.4 of [RFC8446].

   In a constrained CoAP environment, endpoints can't always afford to
   establish a DTLS connection for every EST transaction.
   Authenticating and negotiating DTLS keys requires resources on low-
   end endpoints and consumes valuable bandwidth.  To alleviate this
   situation, an EST-coaps DTLS connection MAY remain open for
   sequential EST transactions.  For example, an EST csrattrs request
   that is followed by a simpleenroll request can use the same
   authenticated DTLS connection.  However, when a cacerts request is
   included in the set of sequential EST transactions, some additional
   security considerations apply regarding the use of the Implicit and
   Explicit TA database as explained in Section 10.1.

   Given that after a successful enrollment, it is more likely that a
   new EST transaction will take place after a significant amount of
   time, the DTLS connections SHOULD only be kept alive for EST messages
   that are relatively close to each other.  In some cases, like NAT
   rebinding, keeping the state of a connection is not possible when
   devices sleep for extended periods of time.  In such occasions,
   [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id] negotiates a connection ID that can
   eliminate the need for new handshake and its additional cost.

5.  Protocol Design

   EST-coaps uses CoAP to transfer EST messages, aided by Block-Wise
   Transfer [RFC7959] to avoid IP fragmentation.  The use of Blocks for
   the transfer of larger EST messages is specified in Section 5.6.
   Figure 1 shows the layered EST-coaps architecture.

   The EST-coaps protocol design follows closely the EST design.  The
   supported message types in EST-coaps are:

   o  CA certificate retrieval needed to receive the complete set of CA
      certificates.

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                       May 2019


   o  Simple enroll and re-enroll for a CA to sign public client
      identity key.

   o  Certificate Signing Request (CSR) attribute messages that inform
      the client of the fields to include in a CSR.

   o  Server-side key generation messages to provide a private client
      identity key when the client choses so.

5.1.  Discovery and URIs

   EST-coaps is targeted for low-resource networks with small packets.
   Saving header space is important and short EST-coaps URIs are
   specified in this document.  These URIs are shorter than the ones in
   [RFC7030].  Two example EST-coaps resource path names are:

   coaps://example.com:<port>/.well-known/est/<short-est>
   coaps://example.com:<port>/.well-known/est/
                                              ArbitraryLabel/<short-est>

   The short-est strings are defined in Table 1.  Arbitrary Labels are
   usually defined and used by EST CAs in order to route client requests
   to the appropriate certificate profile.  Implementers should consider
   using short labels to minimize transmission overhead.

   The EST-coaps server URIs, obtained through discovery of the EST-
   coaps resource(s) as shown below, are of the form:

   coaps://example.com:<port>/<root-resource>/<short-est>
   coaps://example.com:<port>/<root-resource>/
                                              ArbitraryLabel/<short-est>

   Figure 5 in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7030] enumerates the operations and
   corresponding paths which are supported by EST.  Table 1 provides the
   mapping from the EST URI path to the shorter EST-coaps URI path.

   The /skg message is the EST /serverkeygen equivalent where the client
   requests for a certificate in PKCS#7 format and a private key.  If
   the client prefers a single application/pkix-cert certificate instead
   of PKCS#7, she will make an /skc request.

   Clients and servers MUST support the short resource EST-coaps URIs.

   In the context of CoAP, the presence and location of (path to) the
   EST resources are discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-
   known/core" including a resource type (RT) parameter with the value
   "ace.est*" [RFC6690].  The example below shows the discovery over
   CoAPS of the presence and location of EST-coaps resources.  Linefeeds
   are included only for readability.

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=ace.est*

   </est/skc>;rt="ace.est.skc";ct=62

   The first three lines of the discovery response above MUST be
   returned if the server supports resource discovery.  The last three
   lines are only included if the corresponding EST functions are
   implemented.  The Content-Formats in the response allow the client to
   request one that is supported by the server.  These are the values
   that would be sent in the client request with an Accept option.

   Discoverable port numbers can be returned in the response payload.
   An example response payload for non-default CoAPS server port 61617
   follows below.  Linefeeds are included only for readability.

   The server MUST support the default /.well-known/est root resource.
   The server SHOULD support resource discovery when he supports non-
   default URIs (like /est or /est/ArbitraryLabel) or ports.  The client
   SHOULD use resource discovery when she is unaware of the available
   EST-coaps resources.

   Throughout this document the example root resource of /est is used.

5.2.  Mandatory/optional EST Functions

   This specification contains a set of required-to-implement functions,
   optional functions, and not specified functions.  The latter ones are
   deemed too expensive for low-resource devices in payload and
   calculation times.

   Table 2 specifies the mandatory-to-implement or optional
   implementation of the EST-coaps functions.  Discovery of the
   existence of optional functions is described in Section 5.1.

   While [RFC7030] permits a number of these functions to be used
   without authentication, this specification requires that the client
   MUST be authenticated for all functions.

5.3.  Payload formats

   EST-coaps is designed for low-resource devices and hence does not
   need to send Base64-encoded data.  Simple binary is more efficient
   (30% smaller payload) and well supported by CoAP.  Thus, the payload
   for a given Media-Type follows the ASN.1 structure of the Media-Type
   and is transported in binary format.

   The Content-Format (HTTP Media-Type equivalent) of the CoAP message
   determines which EST message is transported in the CoAP payload.  The
   Media-Types specified in the HTTP Content-Type header (Section 3.2.2
   of [RFC7030]) are specified by the Content-Format Option (12) of
   CoAP.  The combination of URI-Path and Content-Format in EST-coaps
   MUST map to an allowed combination of URI and Media-Type in EST.  The
   required Content-Formats for these requests and response messages are
   defined in Section 9.1.  The CoAP response codes are defined in
   Section 5.5.

   Content-Format TBD287 can be used in place of 281 to carry a single
   certificate instead of a PKCS#7 container in a /crts, /sen, /sren or
   /skg response.  Content-Format 281 MUST be supported by EST-coaps
   servers.  Servers MAY also support Content-Format TBD287.  It is up
   to the client to support only Content-Format 281, TBD287 or both.
   The client will use a COAP Accept Option in the request to express
   the preferred response Content-Format.  If an Accept Option is not
   included in the request, the client is not expressing any preference
   and the server SHOULD choose format 281.

   Content-Format 286 is used in /sen, /sren and /skg requests and 285
   in /att responses.

   A representation with Content-Format identifier 62 contains a
   collection of representations along with their respective Content-
   Format.  The Content-Format identifies the Media-Type application/
   multipart-core specified in [I-D.ietf-core-multipart-ct].  For
   example, a collection, containing two representations in response to
   a EST-coaps server-side key generation /skg request, could include a
   private key in PKCS#8 [RFC5958] with Content-Format identifier 284
   (0x011C) and a single certificate in a PKCS#7 container with Content-
   Format identifier 281 (0x0119).  Such a collection would look like
   [284,h'0123456789abcdef', 281,h'fedcba9876543210'] in diagnostic CBOR
   notation.  The serialization of such CBOR content would be

                   Multipart /skg response serialization

   When the client makes an /skc request the certificate returned with
   the private key is a single X.509 certificate (not a PKCS#7
   container) with Content-Format identifier TBD287 (0x011F) instead of
   281.  In cases where the private key is encrypted with CMS (as
   explained in Section 5.8) the Content-Format identifier is 280
   (0x0118) instead of 284.  The key and certificate representations are
   ASN.1 encoded in binary format.  An example is shown in Appendix A.3.

5.4.  Message Bindings

   The general EST-coaps message characteristics are:

   o  EST-coaps servers sometimes need to provide delayed responses
      which are conveyed with an empty ACK or an ACK containing response
      code 5.03 as explained in Section 5.7.  Thus, it is RECOMMENDED
      for implementers to send EST-coaps requests in confirmable CON
      CoAP messages.

   o  The CoAP Options used are Uri-Host, Uri-Path, Uri-Port, Content-
      Format, Block1, Block2, and Accept.  These CoAP Options are used
      to communicate the HTTP fields specified in the EST REST messages.
      The Uri-host and Uri-Port Options can be omitted from the COAP
      message sent on the wire.  When omitted, they are logically
      assumed to be the transport protocol destination address and port
      respectively.  Explicit Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options are
      typically used when an endpoint hosts multiple virtual servers and
      uses the Options to route the requests accordingly.  Other COAP
      Options should be handled in accordance with [RFC7252].

   o  EST URLs are HTTPS based (https://), in CoAP these are assumed to
      be translated to CoAPS (coaps://)

   Table 1 provides the mapping from the EST URI path to the EST-coaps
   URI path.  Appendix A includes some practical examples of EST
   messages translated to CoAP.

5.5.  CoAP response codes

   Section 5.9 of [RFC7252] and Section 7 of [RFC8075] specify the
   mapping of HTTP response codes to CoAP response codes.  The success
   code in response to an EST-coaps GET request (/crts, /att), is 2.05.
   Similarly, 2.04 is used in successfull response to EST-coaps POST
   requests (/sen, /sren, /skg, /skc).

   EST makes use of HTTP 204 or 404 responses when a resource is not
   available for the client.  In EST-coaps 2.04 is used in response to a
   POST (/sen, /sren, /skg, /skc). 4.04 is used when the resource is not
   available for the client.

   HTTP response code 202 with a Retry-After header in [RFC7030] has no
   equivalent in CoAP.  HTTP 202 with Retry-After is used in EST for
   delayed server responses.  Section 5.7 specifies how EST-coaps
   handles delayed messages with 5.03 responses with a Max-Age Option.

   Additionally, EST's HTTP 400, 401, 403, 404 and 503 status codes have
   their equivalent CoAP 4.00, 4.01, 4.03, 4.04 and 5.03 response codes
   in EST-coaps.  Table 3 summarizes the EST-coaps response codes.

5.6.  Message fragmentation

   DTLS defines fragmentation only for the handshake and not for secure
   data exchange (DTLS records).  [RFC6347] states that to avoid using
   IP fragmentation, which involves error-prone datagram reconstitution,
   invokers of the DTLS record layer should size DTLS records so that
   they fit within any Path MTU estimates obtained from the record
   layer.  In addition, invokers residing on a 6LoWPAN over IEEE
   802.15.4 [ieee802.15.4] network should attempt to size CoAP messages
   such that each DTLS record will fit within one or two IEEE 802.15.4
   frames.

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                       May 2019


   That is not always possible in EST-coaps.  Even though ECC
   certificates are small in size, they can vary greatly based on
   signature algorithms, key sizes, and Object Identifier (OID) fields
   used.  For 256-bit curves, common ECDSA cert sizes are 500-1000 bytes
   which could fluctuate further based on the algorithms, OIDs, Subject
   Alternative Names (SAN) and cert fields.  For 384-bit curves, ECDSA
   certificates increase in size and can sometimes reach 1.5KB.
   Additionally, there are times when the EST cacerts response from the
   server can include multiple certificates that amount to large
   payloads.  Section 4.6 of CoAP [RFC7252] describes the possible
   payload sizes: "if nothing is known about the size of the headers,
   good upper bounds are 1152 bytes for the message size and 1024 bytes
   for the payload size".  Section 4.6 of [RFC7252] also suggests that
   IPv4 implementations may want to limit themselves to more
   conservative IPv4 datagram sizes such as 576 bytes.  Even with ECC,
   EST-coaps messages can still exceed MTU sizes on the Internet or
   6LoWPAN [RFC4919] (Section 2 of [RFC7959]).  EST-coaps needs to be
   able to fragment messages into multiple DTLS datagrams.

   To perform fragmentation in CoAP, [RFC7959] specifies the Block1
   Option for fragmentation of the request payload and the Block2 Option
   for fragmentation of the return payload of a CoAP flow.  As explained
   in Section 1 of [RFC7959], block-wise transfers should be used in
   Confirmable CoAP messages to avoid the exacerbation of lost blocks.
   Both EST-coaps clients and servers MUST support Block2.  EST-coaps
   servers MUST also support Block1.  The EST-coaps client MUST support
   Block1 only if it sends EST-coaps requests with an IP packet size
   that exceeds the Path MTU.

   [RFC7959] also defines Size1 and Size2 Options to provide size
   information about the resource representation in a request and
   response.  EST-client and server MAY support Size1 and Size2 Options.

   Examples of fragmented EST-coaps messages are shown in Appendix B.

5.7.  Delayed Responses

   Server responses can sometimes be delayed.  According to
   Section 5.2.2 of [RFC7252], a slow server can acknowledge the request
   and respond later with the requested resource representation.  In
   particular, a slow server can respond to an EST-coaps enrollment
   request with an empty ACK with code 0.00, before sending the
   certificate to the client after a short delay.  If the certificate
   response is large, the server will need more than one Block2 blocks
   to transfer it.

   This situation is shown in Figure 2.  The client sends an enrollment
   request that uses N1+1 Block1 blocks.  The server uses an empty 0.00

   ACK to announce the delayed response which is provided later with
   2.04 messages containing N2+1 Block2 Options.  The first 2.04 is a
   confirmable message that is acknowledged by the client.  Onwards,
   having received the first 256 bytes in the first Block2 block, the
   client asks for a block reduction to 128 bytes in a confirmable
   enrollment request and acknowledges the Block2 blocks sent up to that
   point.

               Figure 2: EST-COAP enrollment with short wait

   If the server is very slow (i.e. minutes) in providing the response
   (i.e. when a manual intervention is needed), he SHOULD respond with
   an ACK containing response code 5.03 (Service unavailable) and a Max-
   Age Option to indicate the time the client SHOULD wait to request the
   content later.  After a delay of Max-Age, the client SHOULD resend
   the identical CSR to the server.  As long as the server responds with
   response code 5.03 (Service Unavailable) with a Max-Age Option, the
   client SHOULD keep resending the enrollment request until the server
   responds with the certificate or the client abandons for other
   reasons.

   To demonstrate this scenario, Figure 3 shows a client sending an
   enrollment request that uses N1+1 Block1 blocks to send the CSR to
   the server.  The server needs N2+1 Block2 blocks to respond, but also
   needs to take a long delay (minutes) to provide the response.

   Consequently, the server uses a 5.03 ACK response with a Max-Age
   Option.  The client waits for a period of Max-Age as many times as
   she receives the same 5.03 response and retransmits the enrollment
   request until she receives a certificate in a fragmented 2.04
   response.  Note that the server asks for a decrease in the block size
   when acknowledging the first Block2.

5.8.  Server-side Key Generation

   In scenarios where it is desirable that the server generates the
   private key, server-side key generation should be used.  Such
   scenarios could be when it is considered more secure to generate at
   the server the long-lived random private key that identifies the
   client, or when the resources spent to generate a random private key



van der Stok, et al.    Expires December 1, 2019               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                       May 2019


   at the client are considered scarce, or when the security policy
   requires that the certificate public and corresponding private keys
   are centrally generated and controlled.  Of course, that does not
   eliminate the need for proper random numbers in various protocols
   like (D)TLS (Section 10.1).

   When requesting server-side key generation, the client asks for the
   server or proxy to generate the private key and the certificate which
   are transferred back to the client in the server-side key generation
   response.  In all respects, the server SHOULD treat the CSR as it
   would treat any enroll or re-enroll CSR; the only distinction here is
   that the server MUST ignore the public key values and signature in
   the CSR.  These are included in the request only to allow re-use of
   existing codebases for generating and parsing such requests.

   The client /skg request is for a certificate in a PKCS#7 container
   and private key in two application/multipart-core elements.
   Respectively, an /skc request is for a single application/pkix-cert
   certificate and a private key.  The private key Content-Format
   requested by the client is depicted in the PKCS#10 CSR request.  If
   the request contains SMIMECapabilities and DecryptKeyIdentifier or
   AsymmetricDecryptKeyIdentifier the client is expecting Content-Format
   280 for the private key.  Then the private key is encrypted
   symmetrically or asymmetrically as per [RFC7030].  The symmetric key
   or the asymmetric keypair establishment method is out of scope of the
   specification.  A /skg or /skc request with a CSR without
   SMIMECapabilities expects an application/multipart-core with an
   unencrypted PKCS#8 private key with Content-Format 284.

   The EST-coaps server-side key generation response is returned with
   Content-Format application/multipart-core
   [I-D.ietf-core-multipart-ct] containing a CBOR array with four items
   (Section 5.3) .  The two representations (each consisting of two CBOR
   array items) do not have to be in a particular order since each
   representation is preceded by its Content-Format ID.  The private key
   can be in unprotected PKCS#8 [RFC5958] format (Content-Format 284) or
   protected inside of CMS SignedData (Content-Format 280).  The
   SignedData is signed by the party that generated the private key,
   which may be the EST server or the EST CA.  The SignedData is further
   protected by placing it inside of a CMS EnvelopedData as explained in
   Section 4.4.2 of [RFC7030].  In summary, the symmetrically encrypted
   key is included in the encryptedKey attribute in a KEKRecipientInfo
   structure.  In the case where the asymmetric encryption key is
   suitable for transport key operations the generated private key is
   encrypted with a symmetric key which is encrypted by the client
   defined (in the CSR) asymmetric public key and is carried in an
   encryptedKey attribute in a KeyTransRecipientInfo structure.
   Finally, if the asymmetric encryption key is suitable for key



van der Stok, et al.    Expires December 1, 2019               [Page 19]

   agreement, the generated private key is encrypted with a symmetric
   key which is encrypted by the client defined (in the CSR) asymmetric
   public key and is carried in an recipientEncryptedKeys attribute in a
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo.

   [RFC7030] recommends the use of additional encryption of the returned
   private key.  For the context of this specification, clients and
   servers that choose to support server-side key generation MUST
   support unprotected (PKCS#8) private keys (Content-Format 284).
   Symmetric or asymmetric encryption of the private key (CMS
   EnvelopedData, Content-Format 280) SHOULD be supported for
   deployments where end-to-end encryption needs to be provided between
   the client and a server.  Such cases could include architectures
   where an entity between the client and the CA terminates the DTLS
   connection (Registrar in Figure 4).

6.  HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar

   In real-world deployments, the EST server will not always reside
   within the CoAP boundary.  The EST server can exist outside the
   constrained network in which case it will support TLS/HTTP instead of
   CoAPS.  In such environments EST-coaps is used by the client within
   the CoAP boundary and TLS is used to transport the EST messages
   outside the CoAP boundary.  A Registrar at the edge is required to
   operate between the CoAP environment and the external HTTP network as
   shown in Figure 4.

       Figure 4: EST-coaps-to-HTTPS Registrar at the CoAP boundary.

   The EST-coaps-to-HTTPS Registrar MUST terminate EST-coaps downstream
   and initiate EST connections over TLS upstream.  The Registrar MUST
   authenticate and OPTIONALLY authorize the clients and it MUST be
   authenticated by the EST server or CA.  The trust relationship
   between the Registrar and the EST server SHOULD be pre-established




van der Stok, et al.    Expires December 1, 2019               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                       May 2019


   for the Registrar to proxy these connections on behalf of various
   clients.

   When enforcing Proof-of-Possession (POP) linking, the DTLS tls-unique
   value of the (D)TLS session is used to prove that the private key
   corresponding to the public key is in the possession of the client
   and was used to establish the connection as explained in Section 4.
   The POP linking information is lost between the EST-coaps client and
   the EST server when a Registrar is present.  The EST server becomes
   aware of the presence of a Registrar from its TLS client certificate
   that includes id-kp-cmcRA [RFC6402] extended key usage extension
   (EKU).  As explained in Section 3.7 of [RFC7030], the EST server
   SHOULD apply an authorization policy consistent with a Registrar
   client.  For example, it could be configured to accept POP linking
   information that does not match the current TLS session because the
   authenticated EST client Registrar has verified this information when
   acting as an EST server.

   For some use cases, clients that leverage server-side key generation
   might prefer for the enrolled keys to be generated by the Registrar
   if the CA does not support server-side key generation.  Such
   Registrar is responsible for generating a new CSR signed by a new key
   which will be returned to the client along with the certificate from
   the CA.  In these cases, the Registrar MUST support random number
   generation using proper entropy.

   Table 1 contains the URI mappings between EST-coaps and EST that the
   Registrar MUST adhere to.  Section 5.5 of this specification and
   Section 7 of [RFC8075] define the mappings between EST-coaps and HTTP
   response codes, that determine how the Registrar MUST translate CoAP
   response codes from/to HTTP status codes.  The mapping from CoAP
   Content-Format to HTTP Media-Type is defined in Section 9.1.
   Additionally, a conversion from CBOR major type 2 to Base64 encoding
   MUST take place at the Registrar when server-side key generation is
   supported.  If CMS end-to-end encryption is employed for the private
   key, the encrypted CMS EnvelopedData blob MUST be converted to binary
   in CBOR type 2 downstream to the client.

   Due to fragmentation of large messages into blocks, an EST-coaps-to-
   HTTP Registrar MUST reassemble the BLOCKs before translating the
   binary content to Base64, and consecutively relay the message
   upstream.

   The EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar MUST support resource discovery
   according to the rules in Section 5.1.  Section 5.1.

7.  Parameters

   This section addresses transmission parameters described in sections
   4.7 and 4.8 of [RFC7252].  EST does not impose any unique values on
   the CoAP parameters in [RFC7252], but the EST parameter values need
   to be tuned to the CoAP parameter values.

   It is recommended, based on experiments, to follow the default CoAP
   configuration parameters ([RFC7252]).  However, depending on the
   implementation scenario, retransmissions and timeouts can also occur
   on other networking layers, governed by other configuration
   parameters.  A change in a server parameter MUST ensure the adjusted
   value is also available to all the endpoints with which these
   adjusted values are to be used to communicate.

   Some further comments about some specific parameters, mainly from
   Table 2 in [RFC7252]:

   o  NSTART: A parameter that controls the number of simultaneous
      outstanding interactions that a client maintains to a given
      server.  An EST-coaps client is not expected to interact with more
      than one servers at the same time, which is the default NSTART
      value defined in [RFC7252].

   o  DEFAULT_LEISURE: This setting is only relevant in multicast
      scenarios, outside the scope of EST-coaps.

   o  PROBING_RATE: A parameter which specifies the rate of re-sending
      non-confirmable messages.  The EST messages are defined to be sent
      as CoAP confirmable messages, hence this setting is not
      applicable.

   Finally, the Table 3 parameters in [RFC7252] are mainly derived from
   Table 2.  Directly changing parameters on one table would affect
   parameters on the other.

8.  Deployment limitations

   Although EST-coaps paves the way for the utilization of EST by
   constrained devices in constrained networks, some classes of devices
   [RFC7228] will not have enough resources to handle the payloads that
   come with EST-coaps.  The specification of EST-coaps is intended to
   ensure that EST works for networks of constrained devices that choose
   to limit their communications stack to DTLS/CoAP.  It is up to the
   network designer to decide which devices execute the EST protocol and
   which do not.

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  EST server considerations

   The security considerations of Section 6 of [RFC7030] are only
   partially valid for the purposes of this document.  As HTTP Basic
   Authentication is not supported, the considerations expressed for
   using passwords do not apply.

   Modern security protocols require random numbers to be available
   during the protocol run, for example for nonces, ephemeral (EC)
   Diffie-Hellman key generation.  This capability to generate random
   numbers is also needed when the constrained device generates the
   private key (that corresponds to the public key enrolled in the CSR).
   When server-side key generation is used, the constrained device
   depends on the server to generate the private key randomly, but it
   still needs locally generated random numbers for use in security
   protocols, as explained in Section 12 of [RFC7925].  Additionally,
   the transport of keys generated at the server is inherently risky.
   Analysis SHOULD be done to establish whether server-side key
   generation increases or decreases the probability of digital identity
   theft.

   It is important to note that sources contributing to the randomness
   pool used to generate random numbers on laptops or desktop PCs are
   not available on many constrained devices, such as mouse movement,
   timing of keystrokes, air turbulence on the movement of hard drive
   heads, as pointed out in [PsQs].  Other sources have to be used or
   dedicated hardware has to be added.  Selecting hardware for an IoT
   device that is capable of producing high-quality random numbers is
   therefore important [RSAfact].

   It is also RECOMMENDED that the Implicit Trust Anchor database used
   for EST server authentication is carefully managed to reduce the
   chance of a third-party CA with poor certification practices
   jeopardizing authentication.  Disabling the Implicit Trust Anchor
   database after successfully receiving the Distribution of CA
   certificates response (Section 4.1.3 of [RFC7030]) limits any risk to
   the first DTLS exchange.  Alternatively, in a case where a /sen
   request immediately follows a /crts, a client MAY choose to keep the



van der Stok, et al.    Expires December 1, 2019               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                       May 2019


   connection authenticated by the Implicit TA open for efficiency
   reasons (Section 4).  A client that pipelines EST-coaps /crts request
   with other requests in the same DTLS connection SHOULD revalidate the
   server certificate chain against the updated Explicit TA from the
   /crts response before proceeding with the subsequent requests.  If
   the server certificate chain does not authenticate against the
   database, the client SHOULD close the connection without completing
   the rest of the requests.  The updated Explicit TA MUST continue to
   be used in new DTLS connections.

   In cases where the IDevID used to authenticate the client is expired
   the server MAY still authenticate the client because IDevIDs are
   expected to live as long as the device itself (Section 4).  In such
   occasions, checking the certificate revocation status or authorizing
   the client using another method is important for the server to ensure
   that the client is to be trusted.

   In accordance with [RFC7030], TLS cipher suites that include
   "_EXPORT_" and "_DES_" in their names MUST NOT be used.  More
   information about recommendations of TLS and DTLS are included in
   [RFC7525].

   As described in CMC, Section 6.7 of [RFC5272], "For keys that can be
   used as signature keys, signing the certification request with the
   private key serves as a POP on that key pair".  The inclusion of tls-
   unique in the certificate request links the proof-of-possession to
   the TLS proof-of-identity.  This implies but does not prove that only
   the authenticated client currently has access to the private key.

   What's more, POP linking uses tls-unique as it is defined in
   [RFC5929].  The 3SHAKE attack [tripleshake] poses a risk by allowing
   a man-in-the-middle to leverage session resumption and renegotiation
   to inject himself between a client and server even when channel
   binding is in use.  The attack was possible because of certain (D)TLS
   implementation imperfections.  In the context of this specification,
   an attacker could invalidate the purpose of the POP linking
   ChallengePassword in the client request by resuming an EST-coaps
   connection.  Even though the practical risk of such an attack to EST-
   coaps is not devastating, we would rather use a more secure channel
   binding mechanism.  Such a mechanism could include an updated tls-
   unique value generation like the tls-unique-prf defined in
   [I-D.josefsson-sasl-tls-cb] by using a TLS exporter [RFC5705] in TLS
   1.2 or TLS 1.3's updated exporter (Section 7.5 of [RFC8446]).  Such
   mechanism has not been standardized yet.  Adopting a channel binding
   value generated from an exporter would break backwards compatibility.
   Thus, in this specification we still depend on the tls-unique
   mechanism defined in [RFC5929], especially since a 3SHAKE attack does
   not expose messages exchanged with EST-coaps.

   Regarding the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), an EST-coaps server
   is expected to be able to recover from improper CSR requests.

   Interpreters of ASN.1 structures should be aware of the use of
   invalid ASN.1 length fields and should take appropriate measures to
   guard against buffer overflows, stack overruns in particular, and
   malicious content in general.

10.2.  HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar considerations

   The Registrar proposed in Section 6 must be deployed with care, and
   only when the recommended connections are impossible.  When POP
   linking is used the Registrar terminating the TLS connection
   establishes a new one with the upstream CA.  Thus, it is impossible
   for POP linking to be enforced end-to-end for the EST transaction.
   The EST server could be configured to accept POP linking information
   that does not match the current TLS session because the authenticated
   EST Registrar client has verified this information when acting as an
   EST server.

   The introduction of an EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar assumes the client
   can trust the registrar using its implicit or explicit TA database.
   It also assumes the Registrar has a trust relationship with the
   upstream EST server in order to act on behalf of the clients.  When a
   client uses the Implicit TA database for certificate validation, she
   SHOULD confirm if the server is acting as an RA by the presence of
   the id-kp-cmcRA EKU [RFC6402] in the server certificate.

   In a server-side key generation case, if no end-to-end encryption is
   used, the Registrar may be able see the private key as it acts as a
   man-in-the-middle.  Thus, the client puts its trust on the Registrar
   not exposing the private key.

   Clients that leverage server-side key generation without end-to-end
   encryption of the private key (Section 5.8) have no knowledge if the
   Registrar will be generating the private key and enrolling the
   certificates with the CA or if the CA will be responsible for
   generating the key.  In such cases, the existence of a Registrar
   requires the client to put its trust on the registrar doing the right
   thing if it is generating the private key.

Appendix A.  EST messages to EST-coaps

   This section shows similar examples to the ones presented in
   Appendix A of [RFC7030].  The payloads in the examples are the hex
   encoded binary, generated with 'xxd -p', of the PKI certificates
   created following [I-D.moskowitz-ecdsa-pki].  Hex is used for
   visualization purposes because a binary representation cannot be
   rendered well in text.  The hexadecimal representations would not be
   transported in hex, but in binary.  The payloads are shown
   unencrypted.  In practice the message content would be transferred
   over an encrypted DTLS tunnel.

   The certificate responses included in the examples contain Content-
   Format 281 (application/pkcs7).  If the client had requested Content-
   Format TBD287 (application/pkix-cert) by querying /est/skc, the
   server would respond with a single DER binary certificate.

   These examples assume a short resource path of "/est".  Even though
   omitted from the examples for brevity, before making the EST-coaps
   requests, a client would learn about the server supported EST-coaps
   resources with a GET request for /.well-known/core?rt=ace.est* as
   explained in Section 5.1.

   The corresponding CoAP headers are only shown in Appendix A.1.
   Creating CoAP headers is assumed to be generally understood.

   The message content breakdown is presented in Appendix C.

A.1.  cacerts

   In EST-coaps, a cacerts message can be:

   GET example.com:9085/est/crts
   (Accept:  281)

   The corresponding CoAP header fields are shown below.  The use of
   block and DTLS are worked out in Appendix B.

   The Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options can be omitted if they coincide
   with the transport protocol destination address and port
   respectively.  Explicit Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options are typically
   used when an endpoint hosts multiple virtual servers and uses the
   Options to route the requests accordingly.

   A 2.05 Content response with a cert in EST-coaps will then be

   2.05 Content (Content-Format: 281)
      {payload with certificate in binary format}

   The breakdown of the payload is shown in Appendix C.1.

A.2.  enroll / reenroll

   During the (re-)enroll exchange the EST-coaps client uses a CSR
   (Content-Format 286) request in the POST request payload.  The Accept
   option tells the server that the client is expecting Content-Format
   281 (PKCS#7) in the response.  As shown in Appendix C.2, the CSR
   contains a ChallengePassword which is used for POP linking
   (Section 4).

   A 2.05 Content response should contain attributes which are relevant
   for the authenticated client.  This example is copied from
   Section A.2 in [RFC7030], where the base64 representation is replaced
   with a hexadecimal representation of the equivalent binary format.
   The EST-coaps server returns attributes that the client can ignore if
   they are unknown to him.

Appendix B.  EST-coaps Block message examples

   Two examples are presented in this section:

   1.  a cacerts exchange shows the use of Block2 and the block headers

   2.  an enroll exchange shows the Block1 and Block2 size negotiation
       for request and response payloads.

   The payloads are shown unencrypted.  In practice the message contents
   would be binary formatted and transferred over an encrypted DTLS
   tunnel.  The corresponding CoAP headers are only shown in
   Appendix B.1.  Creating CoAP headers is assumed to be generally
   known.

B.1.  cacerts

   This section provides a detailed example of the messages using DTLS
   and BLOCK option Block2.  The minimum PMTU is 1280 bytes, which is
   the example value assumed for the DTLS datagram size.  The example
   block length is taken as 64 which gives an SZX value of 2.

   The following is an example of a cacerts exchange over DTLS.  The
   content length of the cacerts response in appendix A.1 of [RFC7030]

   contains 639 bytes in binary.  The CoAP message adds around 10 bytes,
   the DTLS record 29 bytes.  To avoid IP fragmentation, the CoAP Block
   Option is used and an MTU of 127 is assumed to stay within one IEEE
   802.15.4 packet.  To stay below the MTU of 127, the payload is split
   in 9 packets with a payload of 64 bytes each, followed by a last
   tenth packet of 63 bytes.  The client sends an IPv6 packet containing
   the UDP datagram with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP
   request 10 times.  The server returns an IPv6 packet containing the
   UDP datagram with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP
   response.  The CoAP request-response exchange with block option is
   shown below.  Block Option is shown in a decomposed way (block-
   option:NUM/M/size) indicating the kind of Block Option (2 in this
   case) followed by a colon, and then the block number (NUM), the more
   bit (M = 0 in Block2 response means it is last block), and block size
   with exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by slashes.  The Length 64 is
   used with SZX=2 to avoid IP fragmentation.  The CoAP Request is sent
   confirmable (CON) and the Content-Format of the response, even though
   not shown, is 281 (application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=certs-only).
   The transfer of the 10 blocks with partially filled block NUM=9 is
   shown below

B.2.  enroll / reenroll

   In this example, the requested Block2 size of 256 bytes, required by
   the client, is transferred to the server in the very first request
   message.  The block size 256=(2**(SZX+4)) which gives SZX=4.  The
   notation for block numbering is the same as in Appendix B.1.  The
   header fields and the payload are omitted for brevity.
