      <t>Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is used as a certificate management protocol over HTTPS. 
</t>
	<t>Low-resource devices often use the lightweight Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] for message exchanges. This document defines how to transport EST payloads over secure CoAP (EST-coaps). This allows low-resource constrained devices to re-use existing EST functionality. Example low-resource use cases for EST are: secure bootstrapping and certificate enrollment.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>


<middle>
  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
	<t>Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"/> is used for authenticated/authorized endpoint certificate enrollment (and optionally key provisioning) through a Certificate Authority (CA) or Registration Authority (RA). This functionality is also needed for low resource devices.</t> 

<t> "Classical" EST uses HTTPS and this specification defines a new transport for EST using CoAP. It also profiles the use of EST to a smaller subset of authentication tools.</t>

    <t>IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) <xref target="RFC4944" /> on IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="ieee802.15.4" /> wireless networks are becoming common in many industry application domains such as lighting controls. Although IEEE 802.15.4 defines how security can be enabled between nodes within a single mesh network, it does not specify the provisioning and management of the keys. Therefore, securing a 6LoWPAN network with devices from multiple manufacturers with different provisioning techniques is often tedious and time consuming. An example use case is the application of Bootstrapping of Remote Secure Infrastructures (BRSKI) <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> </t>
	<t>Constrained networks use DTLS <xref target="RFC6347"/>, CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/>, and UDP instead of TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>, HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/> and TCP. EST-coaps replaces the invocations of TLS and HTTP by DTLS and CoAP invocations thus enabling EST for CoAP-based low-resource devices.</t>

    <t>Because the relatively large EST messages cannot be readily transported over constrained (6LoWPAN, LLN) wireless networks, this document specifies the use of CoAP Block-Wise Transfer ("Block") <xref target="RFC7959"/> to fragment EST messages at the application layer.</t>

<section anchor="scenario" title="EST operational differences">
    <t>Only the differences to EST with respect to operational scenarios are described in this section. EST-coaps server differs from EST server as follows:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Replacement of TLS by DTLS and HTTP by CoAP, resulting in:
        <list>
          <t>DTLS-secured CoAP sessions between EST-coaps client and EST-coaps server.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>Only certificate-based client authentication is supported, which results in:
          <list>
            <t>The EST-coaps client does not support HTTP Basic authentication (as described in Section 3.2.3 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>).</t>
            <t>The EST-coaps client does not support authentication at the application layer (as described in Section 3.2.3 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>).</t>

      <t>Many of the concepts in this document are taken over from <xref target="RFC7030"/>. Consequently, much text is directly traceable to <xref target="RFC7030"/>. The same document structure is followed to point out the differences and commonalities between EST and EST-coaps.</t>

  <section anchor="profile7925" title="Conformance to RFC7925 profiles">
    <t>This section shows how EST-coaps fits into the profiles of low-resource devices as described in <xref target="RFC7925"/>.</t>
    <t>EST-coaps can transport certificates and private keys. Private keys can be transported as response to a request to a server-side key generation as described in section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC7030"/> and discussed in <xref target="serverkey"/>. </t> 
    <t> The mandatory cipher suite for DTLS is TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 defined in <xref target="RFC7251"/> which is the mandatory-to-implement cipher suite in CoAP. Additionally, the curve secp256r1 MUST be supported <xref target="RFC4492"/>; this curve is equivalent to the NIST P-256 curve. The hash algorithm is SHA-256. DTLS 1.2 implementations MUST use the Supported Elliptic Curves and Supported Point Formats Extensions <xref target="RFC4492"/>; the uncompressed point format MUST be supported; <xref target="RFC6090"/> can be used as an implementation method.</t>
<t>
DTLS 1.3 implementations differ form DTLS 1.2 implementations because they do not support the uncompressed point format.
</t>
    <t>The EST-coaps client MUST be configured with an explicit TA database or at least an implicit TA database from its manufacturer. The authentication of the EST-coaps server by the EST-coaps client is based on Certificate authentication in the DTLS handshake.</t>
      <t>The authentication of the EST-coaps client is based on client certificate in the DTLS handshake. This can either be
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>DTLS with a previously issued client certificate (e.g., an existing certificate issued by the EST CA); this could be a common case for simple re-enrollment of clients; </t>
          <t>DTLS with a previously installed certificate (e.g., manufacturer-installed certificate or a certificate issued by some other party);</t>

  <section anchor="design" title="Protocol Design and Layering">
    <t>EST-coaps uses CoAP to transfer EST messages, aided by Block-Wise Transfer <xref target="RFC7959"/> to transport CoAP messages in blocks thus avoiding (excessive) 6LoWPAN fragmentation of UDP datagrams. The use of "Block" for the transfer of larger EST messages is specified in <xref target="fragment"/>. The <xref target="fig-est-coaps-layers"/> below shows the layered EST-coaps architecture.</t>

    <t>The EST-coaps protocol design follows closely the EST design. The actions supported by EST-coaps are identified by their message types:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Simple enroll and reenroll, for CA to sign public client-identity key.</t>
            <t>CA certificate retrieval, needed to receive the complete set of CA certificates. </t>
            <t>CSR Attributes request messages, informs the client of the fields to include in generated CSR.</t>
            <t>Server-side key generation messages, to provide a private client-identity key when the client is too restricted or because of lack of an entropy source. </t>
          </list></t>

    <section anchor="format" title ="Payload format">
      <t>The content-format (media type equivalent) of the CoAP message determines which EST message is transported in the CoAP payload. The media types specified in the HTTP Content-Type header (see section 3.2.2 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>) are in EST-coaps specified by the Content-Format Option (12) of CoAP. The combination of URI path-suffix and content-format used for CoAP MUST map to an allowed combination of path-suffix and media type as defined for EST. The required content-formats for these request and response messages are defined in <xref target="iana"/>. The CoAP response codes are defined in <xref target="error"/>.</t> 
        <t>EST-coaps is designed for use between low-resource devices using CoAP and hence does not need to send base64-encoded data. Simple binary is more efficient (30% less payload compared to base64) and well supported by CoAP. Therefore, the content formats specification in <xref target="iana"/> requires the use of binary for all EST-coaps Content-Formats.</t>

    <section title="Message Bindings">
      <t>This section describes the general EST CoAP message characteristics.</t>
      <t> <!-- EDNOTE: From Jim "Rephrase the use of CON" --> It is RECOMMENDED to use CoAP CON messages. This recommendation does not influence the communication efficiency because all EST-coaps messages expect a response.</t>
      <t>The Ver, TKL, Token, and Message ID values of the CoAP header are not influenced by EST.</t>
      <t>CoAP options are used to convey Uri-Host, Uri-Path, Uri-Port, Content-Format, and Location-Path in CoAP. The CoAP Options are used to communicate the HTTP fields specified in the EST REST messages. </t>
      <t>EST URLs are HTTPS based (https://), in CoAP these will be assumed to be transformed to coaps (coaps://)</t>
      <t> <xref target="messagebindings"/> includes some practical examples of EST messages translated to CoAP.</t>
    </section> <!-- Message bindings -->

    <section anchor="error" title="CoAP response codes">
      <t>Section 5.9 of <xref target="RFC7252"/> specifies the mapping of HTTP response codes to CoAP response codes. Every time the HTTP response code 200 is specified in <xref target="RFC7030"/> in response to a GET (POST) request, in EST-coaps the equivalent CoAP response code 2.05 (2.01) MUST be used. Response code HTTP 202 has no equivalent in CoAP. 
In <xref target="pending"/> it is specified how EST requests over CoAP handle delayed messages.
</t><t>
All other HTTP 2xx response codes are not used by EST. For the following HTTP 4xx error codes that may occur: 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 406, 412, 413, 415; the equivalent CoAP response code for EST-coaps is 4.xx. For the HTTP 5xx error codes: 500, 501, 502, 503, 504 the equivalent CoAP response code is 5.xx.</t>
	
    </section> <!-- Message Bindings -->

<section anchor="pending" title="Delayed Results">
<t>
It is possble that responses are not always directly available, and may even necessitate manual intervention to return the results. Delays of minutes to hours are possible. Therefore, each GET request MUST be accompanied by the observe option. When the result is directly available, the client receives the result and forgets about the observe as specified in section 3.6 of <xref target="RFC7641"/>.
When a POST response is delayed, the POST returns a 2.01 (Created) response code, having put a value in the Location-Path option. After reception of 2.01 the client does a GET request with the observe option to the newly returned location. Once the delayed result is notified by the server, the client forgets about the observe.</t>
<t>
Next to the observe option the client must specify the Max-Age option that indicates the maximum waiting time in minutes.
</t>
</section> <!-- Delayed Results -->

    <section anchor="fragment" title="Message fragmentation">
      <t>DTLS defines fragmentation only for the handshake part and not for secure data exchange (DTLS records). <xref target="RFC6347"/> states that to avoid using IP fragmentation, which involves error-prone datagram reconstitution, invokers of the DTLS record layer SHOULD size DTLS records so that they fit within any Path MTU estimates obtained from the record layer. In addition, invokers residing on a 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 network SHOULD attempt to size CoAP messages such that each DTLS record will fit within one or two IEEE 802.15.4 frames.</t>
      <t>That is not always possible. Even though ECC certificates are small in size, they can vary greatly based on signature algorithms, key sizes, and OID fields used. For 256-bit curves, common ECDSA cert sizes are 500-1000 bytes which could fluctuate further based on the algorithms, OIDs, SANs and cert fields. For 384-bit curves, ECDSA certs increase in size and can sometimes reach 1.5KB. Additionally, there are times when the EST cacerts response from the server can include multiple certs that amount to large payloads. Section 4.6 of CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/> describes the possible payload sizes: "if nothing is known about the size of the headers, good upper bounds are 1152 bytes for the message size and 1024 bytes for the payload size". Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC7252"/> also suggests that IPv4 implementations may want to limit themselves to more conservative IPv4 datagram sizes such as 576 bytes. From <xref target="RFC0791"/> follows that the absolute minimum value of the IP MTU for IPv4 is as low as 68 bytes, which would leave only 40 bytes minus security overhead for a UDP payload. Thus, even with ECC certs, EST-coaps messages can still exceed sizes in MTU of 1280 for IPv6 or 60-80 bytes for 6LoWPAN <xref target="RFC4919"/> as explained in section 2 of <xref target="RFC7959"/>. EST-coaps needs to be able to fragment EST messages into multiple DTLS datagrams. Fine-grained fragmentation of EST messages is essential.</t>
      <t>To perform fragmentation in CoAP, <xref target="RFC7959"/> specifies the "Block1" option for fragmentation of the request payload and the "Block2" option for fragmentation of the return payload of a CoAP flow. </t>     
      <t>The BLOCK draft defines SZX in the Block1 and Block2 option fields. These are used to convey the size of the blocks in the requests or responses.</t>
      <t>The CoAP client MAY specify the Block1 size and MAY also specify the Block2 size.  The CoAP server MAY specify the Block2 size, but not the Block1 size. As explained in Section 1 of <xref target="RFC7959"/>), blockwise transfers SHOULD be used in Confirmable CoAP messages to avoid the exacerbation of lost blocks.</t>
      <t>The Size1 response MAY be parsed by the client as a size indication of the Block2 resource in the server response or by the server as a request for a size estimate by the client. Similarly, Size2 option defined in BLOCK should be parsed by the server as an indication of the size of the resource carried in Block1 options and by the client as a maximum size expected in the 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) response to a request.</t>

<section anchor="deploy-limit" title = "Deployment limits">
     <t>Although EST-coaps paves the way for the utilization of EST for constrained devices on constrained networks, some devices will not have enough resources to handle the large payloads that come with EST-coaps. The specification of EST-coaps is intended to ensure that EST works for networks of constrained devices that choose to limit their communications stack to UDP/CoAP. It is up to the network designer to decide which devices execute the EST protocol and which do not.</t>

Upon success, the return payload will contain the root resource of the EST resources. It is up to the implementation to choose its root resource; throughout this document the example root resource /est is used.

No other changes are necessary (all provisional modes etc. are the same as for TLS). <!-- DTLS handshakes use a retramsit times to handle packet loss in lossy environments. as explained in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347#section-3.2.1 --> </t>
      <t>CoAP was designed to avoid fragmentation. DTLS is used to secure CoAP messages. However, fragmentation is still possible at the DTLS layer during the DTLS handshake when using ECC ciphersuites. If fragmentation is necessary, "DTLS provides a mechanism for fragmenting a handshake message over a number of records, each of which can be transmitted separately, thus avoiding IP fragmentation" <xref target="RFC6347"/>.</t>
      <t>CoAP and DTLS can provide proof of identity for EST-coaps clients and server with simple PKI messages conformant to section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC5272"/>. EST-coaps supports the certificate types and Trust Anchors (TA) that are specified for EST in section 3 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>
      <t>Channel-binding information for linking proof-of-identity with connection-based proof-of-possession is optional for EST-coaps. When proof-of-possession is desired, a set of actions are required regarding the use of tls-unique, described in section 3.5 in <xref target="RFC7030"/>. The tls-unique information translates to the contents of the first "Finished" message in the TLS handshake between server and client <xref target="RFC5929"/>. The client is then supposed to add this "Finished" message as a ChallengePassword in the attributes section of the PKCS#10 Request Info to prove that the client is indeed in control of the private key at the time of the TLS session when performing a /simpleenroll, for example. In the case of EST-coaps, the same operations can be performed during the DTLS handshake. In the event of handshake message fragmentation, the Hash of the handshake messages used in the MAC calculation of the Finished message 
<figure align="left"><artwork><![CDATA[
PRF(master_secret, finished_label, Hash(handshake_messages)) 
   [0..verify_data_length-1];
]]></artwork></figure> 
MUST be computed as if each handshake message had been sent as a single fragment <xref target="RFC6347"/>.</t>
<!-- EDNOTE: Account for DTLS 1.3-->
      <t>In a constrained CoAP environment, endpoints can't afford to establish a DTLS connection for every EST transaction. Authenticating and negotiating DTLS keys requires resources on low-end endpoints and consumes valuable bandwidth. The DTLS connection SHOULD remain open for persistent EST connections. For example, an EST cacerts request that is followed by a simpleenroll request can use the same authenticated DTLS connection. Given that after a successful enrollment, it is more likely that a new EST transaction will take place after a significant amount of time, the DTLS connections SHOULD only be kept alive for EST messages that are relatively close to each other. In some cases, such as NAT rebinding, keeping the state of a connection is not possible when devices sleep for extended periods of time. In such ocassions, <xref target="I-D.rescorla-tls-dtls-connection-id"/> negotiates a connection ID that can eliminate the need for new handshake and its additional cost. </t>
<t>Support for Observe CoAP options <xref target="RFC7641"/> is compulsory. The necessity of Observer for long delays (minutes - hours)is explained in <xref target="pending"/>. Observe options could also be used by the server to notify clients about a change in the cacerts or csr attributes (resources) and might be an area of future work.</t>

  <section anchor="proxy" title="HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar">
    <t>[EDNOTE: terminology to be reviewed; because proxy was replaced by Registrar]</t>

    <t>In real-world deployments, the EST server will not always reside within the CoAP boundary. The EST-server can exist outside the constrained network in a non-constrained network that supports TLS/HTTP. In such environments EST-coaps is used by the client within the CoAP boundary and TLS is used to transport the EST messages outside the CoAP boundary. A Registrar at the edge is required to operate between the CoAP environment and the external HTTP network. The ESTcoaps-to-HTTPS Registrar MUST terminate EST-coaps downstream and initiate EST connections over TLS upstream.</t> 
	<t>When enforcing Proof-of-Possetion (POP), a value needs to be used to prove that the private key corresponding to the public key is in the possession of and can be
   used by an end-entity or client. In other words, the CSR the client is using needs to include information from the DTLS connection the client establishes with the server. 
   In the presense of ESTcoaps-to-HTTPS Registrar, the EST-coaps client MUST be authenticated and authorized by the Registrar and the Registrar MUST be authenticated as an EST Registrar client to the EST server. Thus the POP information is lost between the EST-coaps client and the EST server. The EST server becomes aware of the presense of an EST Registrar from its TLS client certificate that includes id-kp-cmcRA <xref target="RFC6402"/> extended key usage extension. As explained in Section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>, the EST server SHOULD apply an authorization policy consistent with an Registrar client. For example, it could be configured to accept POP linking information that does not match the current TLS session because the authenticated EST client Registrar has verified this information when acting as an EST server.</t> 

   <t>One possible use-case, shown in one figure below, is expected to be deployed in practice:</t>

    <t><xref target="est-uri"/> contains the URI mapping between the EST-coaps and EST the Registrar SHOULD adhere to. Section 7 of <xref target="RFC8075"/> and <xref target="error"/> define the mapping between EST-coaps and HTTP response codes, that determines how the Registrar translates CoAP response codes from/to HTTP status codes. The mapping from Content-Type to media type is defined in <xref target="iana"/>. The conversion from binary to BSD64 needs to be done in the Registrar. Conversion is possible because a TLS link exists between EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar and EST server and a corresponding DTLS linked exists between EST-coaps-to-HTTP Regitrar and EST client.</t>
	<t>Due to fragmentation of large messages into blocks, an EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar SHOULD reassemble the BLOCKs before translating the binary content to BSD64, and consecutively relay the message upstream into the HTTP environment. </t>
    <t>For the discovery of the EST server by the EST client in the coap environment, the EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar MUST announce itself according to the rules of <xref target="discovery"/>. The available actions of the  Registrars MUST be announced with as many resource paths. The discovery of EST server in the http environment follow the rules specified in <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>

    <t>The Registrar SHOULD authenticate the client downstream and it should be authenticated by the EST server or CA upstream. The Registration Authority (re-)creates the secure connection from DTLS to TLS and vice versa. A trust relationship needs to be pre-established between the Regsitrar and the EST servers to be able to proxy these connections on behalf of various clients.</t>

</section> <!-- proxy considerations -->

<section anchor="sec-est" title="EST server considerations">
    <t>The security considerations of section 6 of <xref target="RFC7030"/> are only partially valid for the purposes of this document. As HTTP Basic Authentication is not supported, the considerations expressed for using passwords do not apply.</t>
    <t>Given that the client has only limited resources and may not be able to generate sufficiently random keys to encrypt its identity, it is possible that the client uses server generated private/public keys to encrypt its certificate. The transport of these keys is inherently risky. A full probability analysis MUST be done to establish whether server side key generation enhances or decreases the probability of identity stealing. </t>
    <t>When a client uses the Implicit TA database for certificate validation, the client cannot verify that the implicit data base can act as an RA. It is RECOMMENDED that such clients include "Linking Identity and POP Information" <xref target="DTLS"/> in requests (to prevent such requests from being forwarded to a real EST server by a man in the middle). It is RECOMMENDED that the Implicit Trust Anchor database used for EST server authentication be carefully managed to reduce the chance of a third-party CA with poor certification practices from being trusted. Disabling the Implicit Trust Anchor database after successfully receiving the Distribution of CA certificates response (Section 4.1.3 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>) limits any vulnerability to the first DTLS exchange.</t>
    <t>In accordance with <xref target="RFC7030"/>, TLS cipher suites that include "_EXPORT_" and "_DES_" in their names MUST NOT be used. More information about recommendations of TLS and DTLS are included in <xref target="RFC7525"/>.</t>
    <t>As described in CMC, Section 6.7 of <xref target="RFC5272"/>, "For keys that can be used as signature keys, signing the certification request with the private key serves as a POP on that key pair". The inclusion of tls-unique in the certification request links the proof-of-possession to the TLS proof-of-identity. This implies but does not prove that the authenticated client currently has access to the private key.</t>
    <t>Regarding the CSR attributes that the CA may list for inclusion in an enrollment request, an adversary could exclude attributes that a server may want, include attributes that a server may not want, and render meaningless other attributes that a server may want. The CA is expected to be able to enforce policies to recover from improper CSR requests. </t>
    <t>Interpreters of ASN.1 structures should be aware of the use of invalid ASN.1 length fields and should take appropriate measures to guard against buffer overflows, stack overruns in particular, and malicious content in general.</t>

  <section anchor="multipart" title="Encoding for server side key generation">
    <t>Constrained devices sometimes do not have the necessary hardware to generate 
    statistically random numbers for private keys and DTLS ephemeral keys.  
    Past experience has shown that cheap endpoints sometimes generate numbers 
    which could allow someone decrypt the communication or 
    guess the private key and impersonate as the device. Studeis have shown 
    the same keys generated by the same model devices deployed on-line. </t>
    <t>Additionally, random number key generation is costly, thus energy draining. 
    Even though the random numbers that constitutes the identity/cert do not 
    get generated often, an endpoint may not want to spend time and energy 
    generating keypairs, and just ask for one from the server. </t> 
    <t>In these scenarios, server-side key generation can be used. The client 
    asks for the server or proxy to generate the private key and the certificate 
    which is transferred back to the client in the server-side key generation 
    response. </t>
    <t>Sever side key generation for CoAP can be implemented efficiently using multipart encoding</t>

  <section anchor="blockexamples" title="EST-coaps Block message examples">
    <t>This section provides a detailed example of the messages using DTLS and BLOCK option Block2. The minimum PMTU is 1280 bytes, which is the example value assumed for the DTLS datagram size. The example block length is taken as 64 which gives an SZX value of 2.</t>
    <t>The following is an example of a valid /cacerts exchange over DTLS. The content length of the cacerts response in appendix A.1 of <xref target="RFC7030"/> is 4246 bytes using base64. This leads to a length of 2509 bytes in binary. The CoAP message adds around 10 bytes, the DTLS record 29 bytes. To avoid IP fragmentation, the CoAP block option is used and an MTU of 127 is assumed to stay within one IEEE 802.15.4 packet. To stay below the MTU of 127, the payload is split in 39 packets with a payload of 64 bytes each, followed by a packet of 13 bytes. The client sends an IPv6 packet containing the UDP datagram with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP Request 40 times. The server returns an IPv6 packet containing the UDP datagram with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP response. The CoAP request-response exchange with block option is shown below. Block option is shown in a decomposed way indicating the kind of Block option (2 in this case because used in the response) followed by a colon, and then the block number (NUM), the more bit (M = 0 means last block), and block size exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by slashes. The Length 64 is used with SZX= 2 to avoid IP fragmentation. The CoAP Request is sent with confirmable (CON) option and the content format of the Response is /application/cacerts.</t>
